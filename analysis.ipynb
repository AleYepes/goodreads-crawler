         "The second semester at the Academy was underway, and Benedict’s life was now even more complicated than it ever had been. His relationship officially expanded when Sadie joined him and Atropos, not just at their party, but as a girlfriend. That caused some bumps as old traumas resurfaced and cast doubts over their new relationship. All of them were determined to make it work, and because they were able to work through those moments, they grew closer together.\n\nIf balancing a new relationship wasn’t difficult enough, the three of them also had to use Pockets to advance up the Ranks. Having delved up a full Rank during the last tournament, the now-expanded party decided to do it again, leaving the Rank 4 Pocket for the Rank 5. They weren’t alone on that dangerous course, either, as their good friends were doing the exact same thing.\n\nThat pushed both groups into moments where a fraction of a second could’ve meant death for one or more of them. The worst instances came at the hands of different shamans. The blood ritualist almost killed Benedict on their first delve, but his Blood Healing had kept him alive. The worst was the warlord who nearly killed Benedict, Atropos, and Sadie at different points throughout their fight.\n\nThey survived and reached Rank 5, advancing a step closer to the Heavens. At this Rank, their Spheres would allow them to augment themselves. It was normally a huge point in every Holder’s journey, but that took a backseat to what Benedict found out and received from his bloodline. Having been given a gift that would endanger him if it were known, he still used it to help Sadie break free of her family.\n\nThey had a couple of weeks before the semester was going to end. Once it did, they— along with Victor’s group— would be ready for the Rank 5 tournament, which had been shrouded in secrecy. They were focused on not just entering that tournament, but emerging as the best of those who entered. The only thing left afterward would be graduation and then leaving the world behind, finding other worlds with Pockets that they could delve to keep advancing.",

         "The time has come to pay Sawyer back for all of his support and hard work. For taking a chance on Sean when no one else would. For getting Sean the needed supplies for the war back when no one else was able. Sawyer has always been in Sean's court and has gone above and beyond more than once.\n\nAnd let's not even mention the help he's provided to Mihalis and Troy!\n\nSo the lions are off to Nighthome to help Sawyer take the crown, which in goblin society is a lot more like a hostile corporate takeover, combined with counting coup, than any kind of violence.\n\nHopefully.\n\nHowever, as long as they're going to be in the Goblin and Dark Elves homeland, there's a little matter of taking House Uunregarten to task for a number of actions that have impacted House Valens, Sean's wife Cali, their children, and of course the lions. House Uunregarten is about to learn that it is never wise to piss off a lion. Especially not one who is immortal, knows magic, and is going to show up with ten thousand of his best friends to have a ... few words.\n\n This is the last of the Valens' Books. The Author is of course grateful to all of you who have supported him for all of this series. However no amount of begging, whining, crying, or screaming will change his mind. Large sums of money however...\nAlso, if you see a brightly colored box with a nice ribbon on it, and it's not Christmas? Better to leave that one alone!",

His psychic visions leave him filled with dread and confusion about his place in the world. When a snake goes missing from the science lab, and a classmate ends up in the ER from a venomous bite, the blame falls on a favorite teacher. Determined to clear the teacher’s name, Ian confronts his growing psychic powers and the overwhelming feeling that the visions are leading him to something far more dangerous.\n\nAs he digs deeper into the mystery, his visions grow stronger—more vivid, more chaotic—interfering with his music and leading him to a trail of dark secrets and a life-threatening experiment hidden in plain sight. But the deeper he goes, the more his feelings for Bradshaw, the school’s popular heartthrob, blur the line between hate and something much more confusing.\n\nThe Pianist and the Snake is a gripping tale of mystery, self-discovery, and the courage it takes to accept who you are, no matter how impossible it may seem.\n\n-----\n\"I strongly believe in the transformative power of music—not just to entertain, but to heal, to provoke, and to give voice to what words alone often can’t express.

Guided by Virginia, Mariposa begins to understand that the strength to endure the storm lies not in avoiding it but in facing it.\n\nAlthough sequoias are the largest trees in the world, Mariposa discovers that her greatest strength doesn’t come from her immense size—it comes from deep within. As readers follow Mariposa's journey, they, too, will discover the timeless lessons of perseverance, family bonds, and the quiet strength that lies within all of us.\n\nPerfect for readers of all ages, Hidden Strength not only explores the beauty of the sequoia but also inspires with a powerful message of resilience, teaching us that even in the face of life's greatest storms, we can stand tall, grow stronger, and find beauty even in the ashes.",

         "Raising Buddha in the Modern World\nA Holistic Parenting Guide\n\nIn a world racing toward progress, how do we raise children who are anchored, aware, and alive to their full potential?\n\nRaising Buddha in the Modern World is a heartfelt invitation to reimagine parenting—not as a checklist of do's and don'ts, but as a sacred journey of growth for both child and parent. Blending ancient wisdom with modern research, Manika draws from over two decades of experience as a meditation trainer, educator, and mother to offer a grounded, deeply personal guide to raising children who thrive in body, mind, energy, and spirit.\n\nThis book doesn't prescribe perfection—it nurtures presence. Through real-life stories, practical insights, and a holistic lens that honors rhythm, connection, and consciousness, it gently illuminates how everyday choices can shape a child who is rooted in their own inner wisdom.\n\nWhether you are expecting a child, navigating toddlerhood, or simply seeking to parent with more purpose and joy, this book is a companion for your path—reminding you that raising a child is not just about preparing them for the world, but about preparing the world for the light they carry within.",

Shakespeare's greatest plays, the tragedies, revolved around their heroes' flaws rather than their glories.\n\nMatthew Cooney and Donal Mannion shared their time as boys in a rundown neighborhood, without fathers, without comfort, without a sense of tomorrow, then went their separate ways, one to chase the trappings of maturity, the other to the streets. Their days shrouded in boredom, their nights filled with the thrill of the chase, each sought his place and his purpose.\n\nWithin their struggles are the challenges of escape, of outrunning the roll of the dice that placed them where they are, and, in the end, of defining what it means to be alive, to constantly strive for the things that are just out of reach.",

At his side stand Françoise Jacquelin—newly arrived from France—and Wabanaki allies whose homelands shape every choice they make.\n\nAcross the Bay of Fundy, rival governor Charles de Menou d’Aulnay raises ships and soldiers to bring Acadia under his rule. As winter hunger, shifting tides, and court intrigues close in, oaths are tested and love is forced into the line of fire. When d’Aulnay’s fleet appears off the palisades, Françoise must decide whether to yield or hold the ramparts and risk everything.\n\nTides of Acadia brings the La Tour–d’Aulnay war to life—from Port‑Royal to the Saint John River—blending siege, seamanship, and a cross‑cultural bond that refuses to break.\n\nFor readers who enjoy\n\nMaritime adventures on a raw frontier\nColonial New France and Acadian history\nStrong female leads under siege\nCross‑cultural alliances and moral courage",
