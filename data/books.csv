His relationship officially expanded when Sadie joined him and Atropos, not just at their party, but as a girlfriend. That caused some bumps as old traumas resurfaced and cast doubts over their new relationship. All of them were determined to make it work, and because they were able to work through those moments, they grew closer together.

If balancing a new relationship wasn’t difficult enough, the three of them also had to use Pockets to advance up the Ranks. Having delved up a full Rank during the last tournament, the now-expanded party decided to do it again, leaving the Rank 4 Pocket for the Rank 5. They weren’t alone on that dangerous course, either, as their good friends were doing the exact same thing.

That pushed both groups into moments where a fraction of a second could’ve meant death for one or more of them. The worst instances came at the hands of different shamans. The blood ritualist almost killed Benedict on their first delve, but his Blood Healing had kept him alive. The worst was the warlord who nearly killed Benedict, Atropos, and Sadie at different points throughout their fight.

They survived and reached Rank 5, advancing a step closer to the Heavens. At this Rank, their Spheres would allow them to augment themselves. It was normally a huge point in every Holder’s journey, but that took a backseat to what Benedict found out and received from his bloodline. Having been given a gift that would endanger him if it were known, he still used it to help Sadie break free of her family.

They had a couple of weeks before the semester was going to end. Once it did, they— along with Victor’s group— would be ready for the Rank 5 tournament, which had been shrouded in secrecy. They were focused on not just entering that tournament, but emerging as the best of those who entered. The only thing left afterward would be graduation and then leaving the world behind, finding other worlds with Pockets that they could delve to keep advancing.",243732978:4.55:523|235718610:4.79:1445|243251749:4.77:203|221761781:4.71:1536|244082664:4.76:217|243655738:4.51:831|240039324:4.65:501|239713764:4.81:623|238227357:4.62:993|237773259:4.68:622|236568919:4.54:604|243291528:4.6:317|235787056:4.64:1057|242367877:4.76:273|242107358:4.57:569|241386929:4.62:770|243455810:4.84:615|239916610:4.64:1225|241661760:4.55:629|231258916:4.6:499

For taking a chance on Sean when no one else would. For getting Sean the needed supplies for the war back when no one else was able. Sawyer has always been in Sean's court and has gone above and beyond more than once.

And let's not even mention the help he's provided to Mihalis and Troy!

So the lions are off to Nighthome to help Sawyer take the crown, which in goblin society is a lot more like a hostile corporate takeover, combined with counting coup, than any kind of violence.

Hopefully.

However, as long as they're going to be in the Goblin and Dark Elves homeland, there's a little matter of taking House Uunregarten to task for a number of actions that have impacted House Valens, Sean's wife Cali, their children, and of course the lions. House Uunregarten is about to learn that it is never wise to piss off a lion. Especially not one who is immortal, knows magic, and is going to show up with ten thousand of his best friends to have a ... few words.

 This is the last of the Valens' Books. The Author is of course grateful to all of you who have supported him for all of this series. However no amount of begging, whining, crying, or screaming will change his mind. Large sums of money however...

Fifteen-year-old Thaddeus Volkameria is orphaned by forbidden magic and raised by a pack of enchanted wolves. Guided by a wise owl with secrets of his own, Thaddeus lives hidden from the world, until a mysterious invitation arrives, summoning him to the Enchanted Haven.

At this orphanage, perched at the edge of a cursed forest, children marked by dark magic are sent to disappear… or be reborn.

But entering the Haven comes at a price.
Thaddeus and his companions must surrender part of themselves to cross the magical barrier, for the Haven doesn't welcome strangers without taking something in return.

Together, Thaddeus and three unlikely friends unravel the truth behind his parents' deaths and a vanished boy from within the Haven, and confront the ancient sorcery that hunts him, before the Dark Hollow magic he carries consumes him from within.

Can losing your future give the past a second chance?

Pushing her son’s stroller on a summer day, thirty-six-year-old Teagan Quinn has no reason to think a big change is looming—the kind that happens in a mind-blowing instant. Nothing could prepare her for a shocking heartbreak.

Gripped by the trauma and grief of suddenly becoming a single parent, Teagan leans heavily on her lunch friends and lively Irish family for support. But when something ends, something usually begins—and Officer Luke Pisani walks back into Teagan’s life. Not just any old friend, he was her idealistic first. The man who got away.

As the grieving months go by, Luke is there at every turn, and gradually, old attraction reignites. But as ambivalent feelings challenge Teagan’s new beginning, a series of hurtful anonymous notes arrive, each angrier than the one before it.

With grit and urgency, Teagan must summon her inner sleuth before the letters poison one of the best things that could happen to her—learning to love again.",69590531:4.97:135|231836249:4.82:167|51025854:4.87:82|242902766:4.91:108|241621874:4.91:32|205204603:4.86:83|239166835:5.0:57|201854471:4.82:125|210533284:5.0:73|242757644:5.0:61|54148309:4.92:66|236891153:4.83:133|59138773:4.69:61|217936377:4.92:37|38900221:5.0:28|239623532:5.0:82|213697555:4.71:285|229283660:4.77:222|243163459:4.9:30|224110578:4.78:32

At Hudson Ridge High, secrets have a way of hiding in plain sight—and Ian Darnell’s are no exception. His psychic visions leave him filled with dread and confusion about his place in the world. When a snake goes missing from the science lab, and a classmate ends up in the ER from a venomous bite, the blame falls on a favorite teacher. Determined to clear the teacher’s name, Ian confronts his growing psychic powers and the overwhelming feeling that the visions are leading him to something far more dangerous.

As he digs deeper into the mystery, his visions grow stronger—more vivid, more chaotic—interfering with his music and leading him to a trail of dark secrets and a life-threatening experiment hidden in plain sight. But the deeper he goes, the more his feelings for Bradshaw, the school’s popular heartthrob, blur the line between hate and something much more confusing.

The Pianist and the Snake is a gripping tale of mystery, self-discovery, and the courage it takes to accept who you are, no matter how impossible it may seem.

A Holistic Parenting Guide

In a world racing toward progress, how do we raise children who are anchored, aware, and alive to their full potential?

Raising Buddha in the Modern World is a heartfelt invitation to reimagine parenting—not as a checklist of do's and don'ts, but as a sacred journey of growth for both child and parent. Blending ancient wisdom with modern research, Manika draws from over two decades of experience as a meditation trainer, educator, and mother to offer a grounded, deeply personal guide to raising children who thrive in body, mind, energy, and spirit.

This book doesn't prescribe perfection—it nurtures presence. Through real-life stories, practical insights, and a holistic lens that honors rhythm, connection, and consciousness, it gently illuminates how everyday choices can shape a child who is rooted in their own inner wisdom.

Whether you are expecting a child, navigating toddlerhood, or simply seeking to parent with more purpose and joy, this book is a companion for your path—reminding you that raising a child is not just about preparing them for the world, but about preparing the world for the light they carry within.",221137502:5.0:40|237582967:5.0:38|237994575:5.0:40|240140549:4.79:39|240386381:4.95:39|238615598:5.0:38|241861135:5.0:41|239923627:5.0:40|241006943:4.98:45|239509554:4.78:175|241424717:5.0:41|235064977:5.0:40|234027510:5.0:31|241147704:5.0:39|238228108:5.0:38|239388389:4.86:29|234398708:4.94:49|236879921:4.91:22|241875567:4.97:138|238007554:5.0:21

Six weeks after the United States entered World War II, Imperial Japan is annihilating American forces across the Far East while the Nazis stand triumphant over much of Europe. Adolf Hitler’s forces are about to commence an assault along the East Coast of the United States, but this “Atlantic Pearl Harbor” would prove far more devastating than Japan’s attack on Hawaii. The wolves are closing in, and few Americans realize their beaches and coastal cities are about to witness the worst naval defeat in American history.

 The Western Hemisphere holds the key to victory for the beleaguered Allies, but only if the vast economic and military resources of North and South America can be carried across the Atlantic by Allied merchant ships. These civilian-manned cargo vessels are the backbone of the American war economy and the lifeline enabling Britain and the Soviet Union to survive—but Hitler’s favorite admiral also knows this, and he has set in motion a plan of unprecedented boldness. Germany’s dreaded submarines, or “U-boats,” are going to the United States.

 The fiery months that followed would pit American servicemen against German U-boat sailors in a desperate struggle that stained East Coast waters with oil and blood. In the crosshairs of this deadly cat-and-mouse game was a stalwart contingent of civilian mariners who crewed the tankers and freighters supplying the war against the Axis Powers. Thousands of them would perish as hundreds of merchant ships were sunk.

 Every American coastal state became a battlefront in 1942, and the events that transpired off New Jersey illustrate the perils and brutality of this forgotten campaign. The seafloor along the Garden State is today strewn with shipwrecks that bear witness to the innumerable ways to die faced by friend and foe alike only miles from the boardwalk. Though these seafarers’ lives were forfeit, the battle they fought would decide the fates of millions.

That is also why we must understand who we are, so we are not manipulated into oblivion by someone or something.

Valyron, a sorcerer bound by legacy, and Leo, a rogue turned warrior, find their fates intertwined when they cross paths with Lucifer—a fallen leader haunted by failure and the remnants of dark magic. Together, they navigate treacherous forests, forgotten relics, and arcane trials, only to face challenges that keep them on the edge.

As kingdoms fracture and alliances shift, the trio must confront their inner demons. Lucifer battles the darkness that once consumed him, Valyron grapples with the weight of prophecy, and Leo fights to outrun his past. With mythical creatures like Draco, the shadow-forged dragon, and the elusive Firebird at play, the line between ally and enemy blurs.

From claustrophobic battles in shadowed groves to the rise of empires and the fall of tyrants, this gripping saga explores the cost of loyalty and the price of peace.

You built the career. Moved across continents. Navigated boardrooms and bureaucracy. You’re grateful. Successful, even.

In this memoir-meets-manifesto, Shivangi TEDx speaker, leadership coach, and founder of one of Switzerland’s top women-to-women mentoring organizations, pulls back the curtain on her own reinvention.

Amelia, who feels she is ready to break away and live the life of an organic human, cannot see how her desire may not end well.
What's worse than an AI gone rogue? Worse is an untethered AI humanoid that has no human life experience, yet possesses more intelligence than the entire research team. What can the research team do to protect her from herself?

Unexpectedly, Russell Carter, former Marine Force Recon Scout Sniper and research team member, gets conscripted along with his team of Marines by a retired Brigadier General to supposedly rescue a High Value Target (HVT) who is about to compromise government security. When Russ and his team stumbled over evidence of a clandestine program while on a five-day hunting trip, they became instant liabilities.

No one was ever to know anything about this black op conspiracy they discovered. What better way to mitigate liabilities than to recruit them into a bogus rescue mission for an HVT with damaging national security interests and targeted for elimination? Easy, one single strike cleans up their mess with a bomb dropped on the bunker where the HVT is held...and a Marine rescue team as unfortunate collateral damage. 

As it turns out, the HVT, which we eventually know as Hal, is a Mod-3 Advanced SuperIntelligence AI (SAI) tagged for elimination because he failed field trials and could not kill on command. Mysteriously, Hal had a functional conscience embedded in his Logic Array, based on a ""Do-No-Harm"" ethic developed by Zackery Hightower when he created AIMEE and Amelia. Zack was aware of the dangers inherent in the nefarious development of advanced AI technology and made a personal commitment to keeping the human race safe from AI-humanoids.

His Conscience Code was posted anonymously to the dark web, and a different developer, Hank Lattimore, who was unknown to Zack at the time, downloaded the code and inserted it into the Logic Array of Hal, along with what should have been a squad of ten more Mod-3, SAI Killer Humanoids. There were indeed ten more AI Humanoids, but they were not killers until they needed to be to defend themselves or the organics under their care. His life changed when Hal failed his field trials, thus confirming that the Conscience Code was effective. Hank became a liability and a new HVT for an entirely different reason.

What would happen if the kill-on-command became a defensive tactic that used violence of action and overwhelming force to turn evil back on itself? What if AI Humanoids could form an emotional attachment because of possessing a conscience? So many what-ifs and so little time...",222792091:4.97:284|51371942:5.0:19|238946391:5.0:22
237623934,A Speck in the Universe,Rohit   Kumar,5.0,26.0,256.0,English,0,0,0,0,29,,,,"""A Speck in the Universe"" is a deeply introspective novel that delves into the ephemeral nature of happiness, the complexities of familial bonds, and the search for meaning in a world devoid of easy answers. The narrative follows a man in his early thirties as he grapples with the heartbreaking reality of his mother's cancer diagnosis. Through a series of reflective memories, he revisits his childhood in Bettiah, shadowed by his father's passing and his mother's enduring strength. These tender yet challenging moments, coupled with quiet betrayals from his extended family, shape his evolving understanding of love, loss, and identity. 

Throughout the milestones of his career, marriage, and fatherhood, he achieves outward success yet is persistently shadowed by a sense of emptiness. Each moment of joy is tinged with sadness, leading him to question the significance of life and advocating for a certain detachment from the present, in contrast to the popular philosophy of living in the moment. Even after fulfilling a lifelong dream of publishing his first novel, the elusive contentment continues to evade him. The story culminates with him sitting on a beach in Chennai, lost in thought, reflecting on his journey, his past, and the elusive meaning of it all. 

Inspired by the philosophy of Albert Camus, ""A Speck in the Universe"" poignantly explores one man's quest to find purpose in an indifferent world. It invites readers to confront the beauty and fragility inherent in their own lives, concluding with a sense of quiet acceptance and a deeper appreciation of life's transient nature.",239274980:5.0:22|239509554:4.78:175|237582967:5.0:38|240386381:4.95:39|238083193:5.0:39|241006943:4.98:45|240140549:4.79:39|241424717:5.0:41|235064977:5.0:40|241861135:5.0:41|239923627:5.0:40|221137502:5.0:40|237994575:5.0:40|234398708:4.94:49|238615598:5.0:38|105276995:4.95:21|238228108:5.0:38|239388389:4.86:29|234027510:5.0:31|231219934:4.9:21

About the Author
When I am asked to talk about myself I always keep it short, my life was never glamorous. I worked hard all of my life and in these pages you will find my struggles, my pain and my mistakes. The destination was never clear but the journey is not over, I'm writing a new chapter. Whether I was loading machines for my family, driving trucks, polishing granite or throwing around four-hundred pound pieces of lumber, a laborer's life is not interesting. One of my favorite quotes is something I wrote years ago; ""We are not to question why there is pain, we are to listen for the thunder and prepare for the rain."" My life in a nutshell. The picture you see gracing the back cover of my first book is my son Dante and his son Braxton. I lost Dante to cancer in 2021. This book is dedicated to him. 

You walked away in silence
I ignored your pleas
you walked away crying
cause I did not believe
I will forever wear this unforgivable sin
for God knows it should have been me instead of him",235282618:4.97:59|180175044:4.84:92|235565943:4.8:46|220848547:4.9:30|229283660:4.77:222|228136359:4.7:79|237351004:4.98:43|231836249:4.82:167|235423403:5.0:23|69590531:4.97:135|236891153:4.83:133|236774844:4.76:97|51025854:4.87:82|241668491:4.95:84|241621874:4.91:32|240728489:4.73:63|223612552:4.92:101|234151341:4.88:51|227248682:4.73:56|231259446:4.92:38

The day Beckett Knox left Sanctuary Island was the best day of Josephine’s life. Throughout their school days, he’d teased her mercilessly, ridiculed her faith, and even played a nasty prank that left Jo reeling for years. She hasn’t thought about him since he left, focusing instead on raising her daughter and keeping the fishing charter company she runs with her dad from going under.

When Beckett left Sanctuary Island at the age of 18, he made himself two he’d never come back, and he’d never believe in the God who had taken his mother from him.

Wrong on both counts.

Now he is heading back to Sanctuary Island to make his next Christian film. Though the island is home to some of his worst memories and biggest regrets—including the way he treated Josephine Fletcher—he hopes the trip will be a chance to make amends.

When Beckett shows up, film crew in tow, Josephine makes it her mission to avoid him. Whatever trick he is playing with his apologies and attention, she’s not going to fall for it. She is certain his apologies—and his faith—are only for show. But that certainty begins to waver when Beckett steps in to help after her dad gets sick. And when she sees him connect with her daughter.

But she’s been hurt by someone pretending to be something he wasn’t in the past. And she’s determined not to let it happen again. Besides, two old enemies can’t become friends. And they certainly can’t fall in love…

Zane Lawrence doesn’t need anything but the family dairy farm and his seven-year-old twin boys for his life to be complete. The single dad works hard all day and chases the boys around the farm all night. His life is a little chaotic – but there’s a delicate balance to it.

So when a pretty young teacher at the boys’ school tries to interfere with some big ideas about their education, Zane isn’t about to let her throw their world off-kilter. After all, she’s new to the school and Sugarville Grove. And it’s bad enough that she’s meddling in his business, but the fact that he’s desperately attracted to her makes him furious with himself.

New teacher Becca Hawthorne sees the Lawrence twins struggling despite their potential and reaches out to their dad right away, excited about her first opportunity to make a real difference. It's crystal clear how much Zane Lawrence loves his boys, so Becca doesn’t expect him to be so offended at her attempts to help. Anyone can see that the man has deep wounds, but his reaction to her feels almost personal. She’s not about to let it stop her from fighting for his kids, though.

When he finally relents, Becca is sure that her dealings with the single dad are over. But for some reason, she suddenly finds herself bumping into Zane Lawrence at every turn. Whether it’s the store, the post office, or the flurry of holiday events in town, she can’t seem to stop seeing the handsome cowboy everywhere she goes.

I live in an apartment building with a bunch of other professionals. We’re not close, but we do see each other coming and going. Which makes things awkward when I realize my cat has stolen my neighbor’s ring. It looks expensive, too.

Well, there’s nothing to do but return it. Unfortunately, rather than apologizing with me, my cat shows no remorse, and returns from our foray with a credit card in her mouth.

Good night. This is really embarrassing. Who is going to believe me when I say my cat took their credit card? I don’t even believe me.

So, my neighbor tries to tell me that her cat loves the parakeet I’m babysitting and then she tops that whopper with another - her cat stole my credit card.

Wow. It’s amazing the lies people tell.

Then I see it for myself. The woman wasn’t joking.

So, what’s a good millennial to do but try to get videos of it and post them on social media? We agree that if we make any money off of them, we’ll split the profits right down the middle. And would you believe we’re soon one of the most popular accounts on BokBik? Well, not us. We made a joint account for our parakeet and cat.

Will a restless cowboy turn all her plans upside down?

When Cora Davies packs up her life and travels to Trinity Falls just before Christmas, her goal is simple. She wants to raise her seven-year-old son in the same small town where his late father grew up. She buys a cute little cottage on the edge of the woods and puts up a wooden fence to keep her son out of the creek—never expecting that this simple act will put her in a passionate conflict with a man who is known in Trinity Falls for his impulsive energy and his dark good looks.

Jared Webb has had his eyes on the property next to the old fishing hole for months. But by the time he manages to put his offer together, an outsider has already had her bid accepted on the land that means so much to him. And the first thing she does is block off access for everyone else. A calmer man might have tried to explain things, and come to an arrangement with the new owner. But Jared marches right up to her without a plan and puts his foot firmly in his mouth, making himself the laughingstock or the hero of the village, depending on who you ask.

But when he hears the young widow’s tale, the hot-headed hunk feels guilty enough to go back and apologize, and he even offers to lend her a hand around the house. He’s doing it because it’s the right thing to do. It has nothing to do with Cora’s beautiful gray eyes, or her charming, adventure-hungry son, who looks up to Jared and suddenly makes him feel like he could one day be something more than a restless cowboy.

The only trouble is that the young widow has put a barricade around her heart that seems even more impenetrable than the fence that started their squabble in the first place.

Henry Keagan has always been a hard-working cowboy, helping to run his large family’s ranch. At his brother’s wedding, he encounters Athena, a woman whose haunted eyes and skittish nature reveal a life of hardship and solitude. Dressed in overalls and eating a little more than the average wedding guest, Athena is an enigma that Henry feels compelled to understand.

When Athena steps foot in Copper Creek, wearing overalls and a guarded expression at a country wedding, she doesn’t expect anyone to notice her, least of all Henry, a good-looking cowboy with a knack for saving things. She finds herself inexplicably drawn to the kindness in Henry’s eyes—a look that promises safety and a new chance at life.

As Henry breaks down Athena’s walls, they discover a mutual need for healing and a connection they can’t deny. But Athena’s past is never far behind, threatening the fragile trust they’ve built. Will Athena find the courage to stay and accept a life she never thought possible, or will her fears lead her to flee once more…

Amy runs the pet sanctuary in Mistletoe Meadows and Jones is the town veterinarian. Amy helps Jones as a vet tech and Jones donates his services for her stray animals. They do pretty much everything together.

When Jones's aunt dies and leaves him a large inheritance, with the condition that he must be married to receive it, he enlists Amy's help to find him a suitable bride. But there isn't anyone he'd rather spend time with than Amy, so it just makes sense that they'd tie the knot, and both of their businesses could use the influx of money.

But will marriage upset the solid friendship they've had for most of their lives? Or will a wedding, and a little help from the Christmas season, show them that there was always something deeper between them?

When the young doctor is called to the local mechanic shop to check on a mysterious stranger, he doesn’t expect that the stranger will be a beautiful woman.

But he has two regrets. And they’re both coming home to roost this Christmas season.

Jensen and his best buddy, Ransom Wright, joined the Army together after high school graduation. Both of them were eager to serve and to learn important skills.

And her big brother hasn’t spoken to him since.

Jensen has been home for a few years now, but his former best friend has finally wrapped up his own service and is coming home this holiday season.

And so is little Willow.

But Willow isn’t so little anymore. And from the moment Jensen lays eyes on her again, he’s afraid that if he’s not careful he’s going to make things much, much worse with her big brother.

When a massive storm leaves the two of them snowed in together, will Jensen be able to resist his feelings for Willow, and ignore the instant bond she forms with his son?

And if he can’t, will Ransom ever forgive them?

Seems the former warden for an area prison has been murdered, and Bay is the chief suspect.

After watching the people around her fall in love and then start a future with their soulmates, Janis yearns to have a relationship like her parents have - one filled with equal measures of laughter, love, and fireworks.

The only problem is that it’s not exactly easy for her to get along with people, and she’s not really fond of trying. That poses a problem for her dream of finding her soulmate, so Janis makes a plan to see if she can adapt to a new way of life and, in doing so, find someone to spend the rest of it with.

Now she just needs to find someone to test out her newfound skills on, and who better to do that than her mortal enemy? If she can make him change his mind about her, then she can win the heart of anyone. Right?

Bachelorhood is perfect for Corey Forrester. He’s got no one to answer to, no one that depends on him, and nobody that he has to take care of. That’s great in theory, and it was a wonderful life for a while, but now he’s ready for something new. Something permanent. Something like the love he sees blooming all around him as his friends fall one by one as they find the person that they were meant to be with.

Just a look from Janis can set him on edge, and listening to her talk is Corey’s own version of purgatory.

Until it’s not.

Corey has lived most of his life believing that Janis was the worst possible woman he could ever fall for - she’s cranky, sassy, sarcastic, and downright mean. So, why is she suddenly sexy and irresistible, and why does he have to fight to keep his hands and mouth to himself whenever he’s around her?

All the best love affairs start with fireworks, although they’re usually the good kind. However, with Janis and Corey in the same room, the explosions were often much more powerful and a lot more dangerous than backyard pyrotechnics. What started out as a test turns into something that might just stand the test of time . . . that is if life doesn’t get in the way.

Join Cee Bowerman in Rojo, Texas where she helps Janis and Corey walk that thin line between love and hate and end up on the Bright Side when they least expect it.",230109298:4.57:732|223782532:4.65:782|228968269:4.57:439|231621846:4.62:645|236900984:4.71:632|234331894:4.63:677|235401355:4.62:374|238439091:4.66:498|228285279:4.75:332|228137070:4.63:369|223810320:4.57:585|227929843:4.67:321|223780007:4.55:489|222862106:4.59:748|224438365:4.63:1133|221793786:4.63:512|233005165:4.62:220|231178435:4.6:198|228249195:4.77:296|228284975:4.66:296

A quick swim helps them save a father, twin girls, and a set of pouty grandparents, but then things take a turn.
Rowan’s daughter Lana shows the family photos of the rescue later, and everybody they just saved has a death omen hanging over them. Save for one person, the grandmother. That means that death isn’t done with the family, and it’s up to Rowan and her merry band of paranormal hunters to find the answers necessary to save everybody involved.

Matt Winston led a charmed life. Great family, great friends, and a girl he’d do anything for.

Then tragedy struck. He lost everything, including his way. He dealt with it the only way he knew how-by becoming the best damn SEAL team leader he could be.

Now he’s out of the service, stronger, wiser, and with a new purpose: turning his burnt-out family legacy into a place where he can help fellow vets find their way back into civilian society.

Nothing will bring back what he lost—except possibly the small town corruption that brings her back to into his life.

When Hayley Freed left town suddenly all those years ago amidst rumors and scandal, the hardest part had been walking away from the only boy she’d ever loved. 

He’d been her knight in shining armor then. In her heart, he still was. 

Now she’s back, and she’s not alone. She’s bringing justice, vengeance, and karma with her. This US Deputy Marshal is on a mission, and it’s as personal as it gets.

And maybe, just maybe, she’ll get a second chance to do right by her knight in the process.

As Matt and Hayley work together to rid their sleepy little mountain town of the rampant greed and corruption that threatens to destroy it, will they re-discover the magic that will give them the happily ever after they deserve?

Will returning be the worst—and most final—decision of her life?

Her family’s ranch, in the shadows of the Wyoming Rockies, is a part of Leigh McCallister’s blood, but not everyone in Wolf Creek welcomes her with open arms. Her mother made a lot of enemies over the years with her shrewd and manipulative business dealings. Some of the locals are already blackballing Leigh’s fledgling clinic. And now that Cole Daniels is back in town, the rumors are starting to fly.

Single dad Cole has come back to Wolf Creek with one goal--he wants to clear the name of his wrongly-convicted father. Guilty, until proven innocent. That was the McAllister family motto, wasn't it? Cole will never forget it—no matter how interested he’d once been in pretty, kind Leigh McAllister. Thanks to her father's lies, Cole's dad had been sent to prison and then died there. And Leigh had testified against him, too.

Leigh and Cole might have gone steady in high school, but there’s no love lost between them now.
But someone is growing edgy, now that they are both back in town, and the threats are growing.

Can they set aside the past and work together before someone dies?

Star Treatment

This 14th installment of the Jerry McNeal Series has Jerry and Gunter heading to Texas.

Along the way, Jerry finds himself dealing with unexpected visitors who challenge his patience and further test his psychic abilities.
Among the visitors is the ghostly spirit of Texas Ranger, Clive Tisdale, who is not a fan of dogs, refuses to tell Jerry why he is there, and if his presence has anything to do with Texas Ranger Raymond Hale.

Raymond Hale oversaw mob informant Antonio Maioriello until both men went missing years earlier and were presumed dead until recent weeks when Maioriello’s image started showing up in tourist photos taken outside the Alamo.

At first, this was presumed to be a camera malfunction, as no one recalled him being present at the time the photos were taken.

Then Maioriello showed up in a photo with the niece of Bruno Deluca – the man Maioriello informed on before being placed in the witness relocation program, and Deluca used his influence to demand answers.

Now, not only must Jerry locate the spirit who is causing the chaos, he must convince Bruno Deluca that Maioriello is truly dead.

Will Jerry and Gunter get to the Alamo in time to defend it from another invasion?

Will Tisdale change his stance about dogs?

Between his two good things, this single dad figures he has the skills and the motivation to make it in his dream job at a repair shop, and give little Zandy the life she deserves.

So, when his mom tells him she’s retiring and leaving him the Christmas tree farm that’s been in the Wilson family for generations, he can see his dreams falling apart before his eyes.

Quinn Allen loves helping living things grow. She’s been saving forever, but she’ll probably never have enough to buy a farm of her own, so running the Wilson Tree Farm is the next best thing. But now the owner’s son is home and the handsome single dad doesn’t even seem to appreciate the incredible gift he’s about to get.

With her mother and niece--now her adopted daughter--in tow, Misha tries to embrace a new life as a doctor in the Halversons’ family clinic in a community far from the type she’d been part of in Atlanta. The Halversons welcome Misha and her family to Serenity Point, happy to have her filling an important role in their clinic. After a long-term relationship left him broken, Jay isn't sure he'll ever be able to have the type of relationship his parents have. However, Misha's arrival in his life brings Jay renewed hope and a desire to try again.

In Jay, Misha finds a man to admire. One committed to his family—both blood and adopted. A man who brings a smile to her face and makes her wonder if perhaps the dream of a family she’d set aside could be realized with him.

Like magnets, they are drawn to each other. But will unexpected events in their lives be the flipside of the magnets, pushing them apart and breaking both their hearts? Or will they be able to trust that God has a plan for everything? Including their love for each other? Jaylen is book 2 of the Christian romance series focused on the lives of The Halversons .

What do you do – when you find a dead man's phone? Not just a dead man's phone, but a phone filled with messages from the woman who still loves him? And when you try to give it back ... she yells at you!

Blaze Cross doesn't want drama. He doesn't do drama. In fact, he normally doesn't even do people. He's a small town veterinarian, who specializes in horses. When he goes to Kentucky to meet with a horse dealer who might know something about the Conquistador Gold, he picks up a stray phone on the ground. One he means to get back to the owner, until he's searched by drug dogs at the airport. Later, when the phone keeps going off, he finds himself reading messages. Messages he shouldn't be reading, but can't stop.

Eden Cappa doesn't want to be stuck in grief. It's been almost a year since her husband passed and between her time in a hospital to get help and the time she spends defending herself to her family that she REALLY is okay, all she wants to do is get away from it all. But she never expected to lose the phone. The only thing that's kept her connected to the man she loved. The only thing thing that allows her to still hear his voice.

When Blaze and Eden find themselves thrown together to help out a giant Husky dog, something starts to happen between them. Something that this horse vet never anticipated; he starts to fall in love.

Will discovering the secret Blaze has kept from her take away all chances of them being together?
Will Eden's history with the Conquistador Gold be the next clue in the puzzle ... or will they team up and find it together?

As the Cross siblings get tested, they find they have to do the one thing their father always wanted them to do; trust each other and protect the land that is their legacy.",217037184:4.8:605|205754942:4.62:237|215209298:4.77:513|203230554:4.69:268|202020381:4.56:446|203657182:4.58:330|203430386:4.74:256|214818946:4.77:262|205220821:4.62:1048|205785320:4.69:877|205785341:4.76:921|225449947:4.72:459|186445960:4.59:1130|218063744:4.72:132|214135987:4.69:205|205164906:4.65:258|205519529:4.69:606|223787610:4.78:656|212336278:4.73:296|217236333:4.71:200

Rhett Coleville, a gorgeous and enticing contractor, rescues her from the mud, from her demonic cousins trying to intimidate her, and stands by her side when it seems everyone else wants her gone.

He came out of it scarred and wounded but determined to continue. Hellfire supported him, and helped him along, but couldn’t protect him from the cruelty of the world. Trapped by a woman who only sees dollar signs, his baby mama tells him quite clearly… she doesn’t want a cripple as her baby dad. Just hand over his wallet and fade into the background.

However, after he pulls her from a near-fatal accident, he’s decided he is responsible for her. She thinks he and two MCs are overreacting. He thinks she’s not paying enough attention.
Then, a series of events force her to face the truth. Someone wants her dead. But the incidents happening seem to follow two different paths. Are there two people after her or one? Nobody seems to have the answer. She’s got the respect of both clubs for her previous sacrifice, and now they’re determined to protect her.
A man fighting for his unborn child and who doesn’t want a woman, especially one who would only ever see his disabilities, finds himself falling hard. She doesn’t want a man; she works too hard and won’t give her career up. But this man’s soul reaches out to her and captures her loyalty and love.

It seems like every man she runs across is either threatened by her success, jealous of it, or cannot deal with such a hectic schedule, but whatever their reasoning, they all seem to resort to the same being unfaithful. Coupled with the fact that she is battling an undiagnosed and debilitating condition that most men find burdensome, the songstress begins to believe that true love just isn't in the cards for her. Having had enough of being mistreated, Yolani vows to focus on her career and her career only until a man can prove that not only can he understand her real life, but that he is mature enough not to fall for any woman with a pretty face and an abundance of assets to match. So when she meets a well-known playboy, famous for his one-night stands, and baby mama drama, Yolani finds it comical and slightly infuriating that he is hell-bent on making her his. What she soon realizes though, is that everything isn't always what it appears to be, including him, but with an overbearing family, fanbase, and jealous contemporaries, Yolani will learn just how difficult obtaining real love is.

Cemone Compton, the cocky, aggressive, and promiscuous NBA player for the Los Angeles Bulldogs is living life to the fullest. Or at least he was until his bed-hopping ways left him with two baby mamas and a set of ghetto twins to match. And his violent behavior, on and off the court, garnered him and his team much negative publicity. Always one to have and get whatever he wants, when he sets his eyes on the most beautiful and talented woman he is sure he's ever seen, he decides to simply make her his. However, what the handsome ball player doesn't realize is that this woman is far different from what he is used to. Unable to dangle his fame, money, cockiness, and playboy persona in her face to make her fall for him, Cemone is nonplussed, becoming obsessed with convincing the woman he truly believes is for him, to take him seriously. Her being a difficult woman to break down accompanied by his uncontrollable temper and conniving baby mamas, has Cemone at a loss.

But one thing this talented shooting guard hates more than anything is losing, especially when it's the woman of his dreams, so he sets out to do whatever and whenever just to have her, allowing nothing to stand in his way.

Find out in this story filled with healing love, shocking reveals, betrayal, and jealousy, just what a man in a deep, all-consuming love will do.

But when the man she trusted the most pushes her aside like yesterday’s news, she’s left standing in the wreckage, trying to piece herself back together. Before she can even catch her breath, she’s pulled into a world she never wanted to be a part of—a high-stakes game of power, deception, and dangerous attraction. And the only way out? Making a deal with Romare ""Ruger"" Croix, an alpha male with a deadly reputation in the streets.

Ruger is the kind of man Kyla swore she’d never entertain—arrogant, dangerous, and the walking definition of power. Too many women fall at his feet, but Kyla? She’s built different. She’s got her own mind, her own rules, and she refuses to be just another woman lost in his shadow. Their connection is fire and friction, a battle of wills where neither is willing to fold. But the more she fights him, the more undeniable their pull becomes.

In Ruger’s world, loyalty is everything, and power comes at a price. Kyla quickly realizes she’s in deeper than she ever imagined, and walking away might not be an option. When a choice presents itself—one that could change both of their lives forever—they’re forced to ask Is this just survival? Or is it something real?

Grief has gutted the Black Flame Mafia, but love... love refuses to die quietly.

Bankston DeLuca is haunted by loss, fueled by rage, and clinging to the one woman who refuses to let him drown. Aurmoni is his anchor—his only source of light in a world gone dark. But even anchors can break when the current pulls too strong. As the walls close in, they’ll have to fight not just for survival, but for each other. Trust is fragile. And in Bankston’s world, love is a dangerous weakness.

Dante Reyes is torn between the blood ties that raised him and the woman who taught him how to feel again. Lena is everything he wants but nothing he’s allowed to keep—not with Giovanni unraveling and enemies closing in. As Giovanni descends further into madness, Dante and Lena are faced with a brutal stay loyal and be destroyed, or walk away and risk everything they've built together.

Old wounds reopen. New enemies rise.

And love—obsessive, consuming, and defiant—becomes the only weapon left.

In Surrogate to an Unhinged Mafia III, loyalty turns lethal, emotions run unchecked, and the line between protector and predator disappears. This is a world built on betrayal and blood, where passion alone won’t save you—you have to be willing to bleed for it.

Kyla Warren never believed in fairytales, but marrying Romare ""Ruger"" Croix was supposed to be a sacrifice of love—love for her family, if not for him. Their wedding day should have been the beginning of something unbreakable, but when disaster strikes, the very foundation of their union is shattered before the ink on their marriage license dries. As raw emotions collide and unspoken desires surface, Kyla and Ruger face a heart-wrenching choice: will they surrender to the chaos threatening to tear them apart, or will they stand defiant together and prove that what burns between them runs far deeper than mere obligation?

Meanwhile, Mocha and Poet find themselves trapped in an emotional deadlock. Both are prisoners of their own devastating pride, each too wounded to yield to the crushing weight of past betrayals and present consequences. But when the devastating truth about Envi finally erupts into the open, Poet is forced to confront a soul-searing reality he's desperately tried to deny. The question haunting their every breath becomes will he find the strength to forgive the unforgivable, or will Mocha lose him forever before their love ever has a chance to truly breathe?

On the other side of the family, Rook and Quest struggle beneath the weight of establishing a stable co-parenting dynamic, but deep-rooted trust issues continue to carve an ever-widening chasm between them. When a sudden, life-threatening danger puts them both in the crosshairs, Rook's world tilts on its axis as he begins to question everything he thought he knew—including the unsettling possibility that perhaps he's the one who should be doubting Quest instead of the other way around.

With calculating exes lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to reclaim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and hidden enemies methodically closing in from all sides, the Croix family stands besieged by forces determined to exploit their every vulnerability. In this treacherous world where loyalty is everything and betrayal waits behind the most intimate smiles, will the bonds of family prove strong enough to hold their line—or will their enemies finally succeed in tearing apart the empire the Croix have sacrificed everything to build?

But he's been thinking about his massage therapist for a while now...

Sterling Boyd struck out on her own last year, right when Luke asks her to go on tour with him. So she says no, and they begin a delicate dance around their feelings for one another. She's desperate to prove to the haters at her former spa that she's capable, that she's worthy, that she's visible.

The problem is, no one has ever seen her before.

Until Luke. He can't get her out of his head, and when she shows up at the Young Family New Year's Eve party, the whole night takes a turn for the better. And when his parents play their silly kissing song, Sterling is the blonde bombshell right in front of him.

Now that real feelings are out, the sparks between Luke and Sterling are hotter than ever. Will Luke's status as a single dad and local celebrity put too much strain on their new relationship? Or will they find that taking a risk on each other is worth it to find belonging and true love?

His mentor has been waiting to see which side he will choose—good, or evil—but Wreck himself doesn't know that answer quite yet. He is the newest member of the Fastlander Crew, but they are very different from him. It is safest for everyone if he remains an outsider. If the Crew knew how dangerous he really is, they wouldn’t have ever let him pledge.
No one can stop him.
No one can tame the monster inside of him.
No one can break down his carefully-constructed walls…until he meets Timber.
The quirky beauty has a dark destiny of her own, and awakens something inside of him that can never be released onto the world. Wreck knows it is safer to stay away from her because she is human, and has no idea what destruction is coming for Wreck and his Crew. It's not fair to put a human in the middle of the war that has been building for so long, but he can't seem to leave her alone. All he knows is that she brings out a side of him that could be the end of the world, and will absolutely be the end of Wreck. She dredges up the monster.

Timber Harris has a decision to make that she wouldn’t wish on anyone. She’s in search of a sign. After a chance meeting with an unlikely hero, she is feeling the winds of positive change finally shift in her direction. Wreck is abrasive and closed-off. He’s a shifter, and she’s never been exposed to shifters before. To the outside world, he is uncaring and cold and dangerous, but with her, in moments of vulnerability, she can see the man he could be. He’s dominant and fiercely protective, but she can drag a smile from him, and that feels important. She can see him slowly growing a heart.
Timber is falling fast, but the closer she feels to him, the more distance he tries to create. A therapist by day, Timber knows exactly what to do to break down those walls. The more she learns about him, the more she realizes humans really don’t know anything about the chaos that is happening in the shifter world.

War has come to Damon’s Mountains. Wreck is the biggest weapon they have, if only he can control his fire.
His destiny was always to become the biggest villain Damon’s Mountains has ever known.
Timber’s destiny is to stop him.

His boss is the dragon who has been keeping shifters both in check and protected since they were forced to come out into the light all those years ago. Humans have granted shifters the freedom to police their own—Damon Daye is the judge, and Lucas Slater is his personal hand of justice. Born in the very mountains he has gone out into the world to protect, Lucas hasn’t been home in years. He is a different beast now than when he left these mountains as an adolescent gorilla shifter. Now he is a fully-mature, dominant silverback gorilla with years of fight training and no family group to anchor him down. Years ago something happened that catapulted him out into the world to find himself. Now that he is returning to Damon’s Mountains, everything he imagined is coming true. These mountains tug at his animal and press him to put down roots that could be the end of him. He is here to do a job, but when he saunters into a familiar trailer park and finds out the name of his next target, everything gets turned upside down. And even more unsettling? A ghost from his past has been brought in to test him, but for the life of him, he can’t tell if the gorgeous falcon shifter has been sent to trap him…or to free him.

Jenna Brown is just doing what she’s been asked.

She is living happily in Damon’s Mountains…but there is something missing, and her falcon is acting out. When she becomes part of an elaborate plan to draw one of the sons of the mountains back into her territory, the outcome feels important for reasons she can’t explain. She has a history with Lucas Slater, but he has no idea how big it is. He is different now in ways that are calling to her body. Massive, dominant alpha male with a big destiny ahead of him, and she has never laid eyes on a man sexier than him. The problem? Her animal is tethering a bond to him, and everyone knows Lucas Slater is a leaver whose animal attaches to no one. She is setting herself up for a big hurt, and messing up important parts of Damon Daye’s plans as their destinies begin to unravel.

They are both a part of something that is so much bigger than themselves—but every wise shifter knows that if you love something, you must be able to set it free.

A new Crew is forming in Damon’s Mountains. Readers have asked for the return “home” for years, and T.S. Joyce has listened in this first epic, full-length homecoming. Read on for new alliances, revelations, tested loyalties, old friends, Crew bonds, flaws that feel like perfection, turmoil that turns to soul-deep devotion, epic shifter battles, and an ever-evolving rebuild of something that was broken, but now will become the future of the mountains.

There’s a new Crew in town.
The Warlanders are going to take us home.

Little does he know, an unexpected ally is breaking into the prison to set some of the inmates free, including the woman who has consumed his mind since the day she was brought down to his cell and introduced into the secret program he is a part of. If the humans knew what was really going on in this shifter prison, it would be all over the news, and Damon Daye seems to want just that. 

Every shifter knows Damon is not the dragon to mess with, but if King plays nice for a little while, he can secure a free ticket into one of the most coveted Crews in the world. Too bad he doesn’t work well with others. Katrina could though, and he would give his ticket to her in a heartbeat if it meant she would forgive him for what happened between them. 

King has been living a solitary life for years now, and being thrown into a team is jarring to the massive silverback gorilla that dwells inside of him. If he can stay out of Cold Foot, he could tie up all the loose ends from his previous life, but inside the walls of that prison, there is something he cannot live without.

Katrina is trapped in the consequences of her decisions.

She was brought to Cold Foot Prison after she helped her lion Pride attack Damon’s Mountains, and now her life is at a dead-end. She has so many regrets, and apologies to make, but she can’t do any of that from the cold walls of this place. When the first dragon roar rattles the walls of her cell, she knows something big is happening. What she doesn’t realize is that she is about to be pulled from her dark destiny, and thrust into a second chance she never expected. She has an old friend on the outside pulling some serious strings to get her a shot at making it into a Crew that others would die to be a part of, but her emotions are swinging high and wide as she struggles to adjust to life outside of the walls of Cold Foot. The one steadying factor? A silverback gorilla shifter she met one horrible day inside, who seems determined to protect her for reasons she doesn’t understand. King is huge, and dominant, and a fighter, but he’s pushing her toward the people she went to war with in Damon’s Mountains, and she can’t figure out his motive. For the life of her, she can’t figure out whether he is friend or foe. All she knows is that he is important to her, and to her animal, and he gives her hope. For a shifter like her, hope is terrifying.

She has no hope of expanding her two bedroom ranch house and doesn't want to rely on the charity of the town, either. She definitely doesn't want some strange man coming in, being too kind, stealing her kids' hearts and turning her world upside down. He'll be leaving when he's done. After all, what man would want a woman with six kids?

Former airman, Gideon Marsh, would've had the single mother's addition done last spring, but he'd broken his leg and couldn't work. But a building project is just what he needs to fill the long, cold, North Dakota winter days. Snow days with the kids will be especially fun.

Except he doesn't know these kids have more in mind for him than being a general contractor. As he's looking into the serious gaze of Piper's oldest son, something in him just can't call the kid's bluff.

So he ends up married.

Shocked at first, he decides it might not be such a bad thing. After all, he's never met a woman who intrigues him quite like Piper. Can he convince her to allow him to be her husband for real?

Kieran would never refuse someone in need, especially orphaned children or the woman whose affection he’s been trying unsuccessfully to win.

Nothing in her life ever goes the way she planned, however.

There are gods afoot, as if Scout didn’t have enough to deal with. The Nordic goddess Skadi is in town, and she has something specific on her mind.

With the new lamia apex down for the count—whether she’ll survive her ultimate transition, nobody can say—Scout thinks she has some breathing room to get to know the family that’s only recently come to town. Instead, she’s got a god to deal with, and Skadi means business.

Scout’s magic is ever-evolving but is she strong enough to face a god?
When another god arrives hellbent on fighting it out with the first god, Scout thinks things can’t get worse. She’s wrong. Things can always get worse.
A god fight is not what Scout was anticipating it. It’s upon her, though. Worse, it seems one of the gods might be partnering with the lamia apex with domination on their minds. What does that mean? An end for them all.

Scout has been reticent about facing her new reality. She’s out of time, though. She either has to agree to take on the mantle of the pixie apex, or Hawthorne Hollow—and ultimately the world—will fall into ruin.

It’s time for a war.

However, their world is constantly shaken by the emotional and toxic relationship she shares with Kairo’s father, Kyron. Once deeply in love, Ash-leigh and Kyron's relationship now lies nearly in the pits of hell, marred by money problems and bitter arguments that their son cannot help but overhear through the thin walls of their humble home.

Rewind to earlier that morning

“Wife?”
“Yes, his wife, as in till death do us part.” The woman in front of me waved her bony finger in my face that had a big diamond wedding ring on it.
I heard Charley, Kitty, and Simmora ranting over Joshua. They weren’t paying me and what I faced any attention.
“Let’s step to the back,” she suggested when she looked behind me at my sister and friends.
At this point, there was no reason for me to object. She switched toward the back like a model on the runway. I watched her put her briefcase on the table, then she turned to me. The woman wasn’t ugly at all. Japanese descent but with no accent.
Her lips were full, her hair was long and brunette, and her skin was milky white. Her eyes were round with a slight slant. I saw the cattiness, sneaky, and scheming ways she had about her. She was too posh, almost like an AI image.
“Let’s start over—”
“We really don’t have to. Your name is Meixiu Sato-Yoshida, and you are Kiyoshi Lee Yoshida’s wife.” There was no need for her to keep repeating that. I finally got it and realized this was real...

""Sometimes our mothers' advice hits hard, but when my Mama told me that all men are dogs, that ninety-nine percent of them will cheat, and one hundred percent of them will lie, she was speaking a painful truth. Some men are just overgrown little boys, never grasping that it's time to man up. Let's talk trust issues, shall we? Tuh. They might wine and dine you, but the second they figure out you're not a woman to be trifled with, they switch up real quick."" Sincerely, a woman emotionally drained from being played and cheated on.

Doll, ever the hopeless romantic, has faced heartbreak more times than she'd care to admit. Finally, she summons the courage to kick her toxic ex, Jerrell, to the curb. Fast forward four years, and a bombshell secret shatters her world—a secret her entire family, including her so-called best friend Stoney, had been keeping from her. Heartbroken and disillusioned, Doll swears off love. That is, until she crosses paths with Scar, the epitome of the men she vowed to avoid.

Scar may have been born into wealth, but he didn't rest on those laurels. Carving a name for himself in the gritty Montgomery streets, he now co-owns one of the most opulent hotel chains in the South. Money pours in, but something—or rather, someone—is missing. A seasoned player, Scar can have any woman swooning, all but one. Doll becomes a captivating challenge, a tantalizing puzzle he's hell-bent on solving.

But then fate throws a wrench into his plans, leaving him emotionally torn between two one he loves, and one he's helplessly in love with.

Meanwhile, Stoney's heart is pulverized when she learns her relationship with Wade was built on lies. Her eyes wander towards forbidden territory—her enigmatic boss, Schizo. Emotions surge like an unstoppable wave, and now she harbors a secret—a secret that promises her the world, if she's willing to shatter a few hearts to get it.",198740980:4.69:897|199606479:4.72:782|199236438:4.69:1614|197147843:4.75:900|202653530:4.72:728|199079041:4.74:804|198634672:4.69:451|198379182:4.72:913|201017038:4.74:777|199263265:4.73:809|205847195:4.72:1172|208954507:4.62:1268|196969233:4.67:568|198976795:4.69:544|201112053:4.64:1405|195245002:4.74:1166|185885954:4.78:915|184715909:4.75:1075|199089659:4.7:1081|209247835:4.58:886

I got up too, placing my hand on the glass partition, desperately hoping he’d reach out and touch his hand to mine. But he didn’t. He just looked at my hand with a pained expression, as if he wanted to bridge the distance between us but couldn’t bring himself to be vulnerable.

After eight years together, the chasm between Phear and I felt cavernous. The man who had taken me in when my mama died by suicide had become a closed-off stranger. We barely hugged anymore, let alone said ""I love you."" I think he resented how much I had come to depend on him over the years. My neediness was too much for him to handle on top of his own issues. But I clung to the shreds of our relationship, wishing we could have the family I always dreamed of.

It wasn’t until a customer offered me a job as a music teacher that I considered leaving. Working with those kids stirred long-buried memories and dreams within me. Little did I know that taking that job would also lead Giuseppe Stefani back into my life after years apart. Just as I was getting to know the captivating Psalms Blue, my messy past came barreling back.

Between my controlling ex who refused to let go, a manipulative new boss, and an old friend who needed me, I found myself caught in a vortex of complicated relationships and choices. My demons, it seemed, were determined to keep their claws dug deep in my heart. The men I should have run from became temptations I couldn't resist.

I need that reassurance that other women often speak about. On God, I'm trying my best, yet life keeps beating me down. Will I take a thug or drug dealer? You damn right I will. Nevertheless, he's still a man, regardless of his occupation, and a man to teach me how to be a woman. Lead me—even if he's got a little gangsta in him. It's something about them hood Philly guys with them big beards, carry big guns, and them deep rugged accents that just... Girl, if you know, you know. Maybe that's too much to ask for. My momma and daddy straight gave me the boot when they found out I was pregnant. So, finding someone to love me, when my own parents couldn’t, feels like a losing battle. My baby daddy couldn't do nothing for me but knock me up, again and again. A fool, that's what I was for letting him—a bum who already didn’t take care of the ones we had. I thought I had some kind of hood love. His PlayStation 5 was more important than his kids. Smdh.

When I got my Section 8, I just knew life was going to get easier for me. NOPE, it only got worse. I was searching everywhere and praying to God daily for a better life. But it feels like God is busy helping someone else, or he just can't hear me.

From the rough streets and projects of Philadelphia, I wasn't aiming to become just another statistic. I was determined to rise, even if it meant doing things I never wanted to.

And just when I thought God had put his AirPods in and left me out to dry, my longtime friend, Keyz, came back into my life. My heart wasn't sure how to act. This man was everything I didn't know I needed—a lifesaver, if you ask me. My body craved that man, and my kids grew to love him too. Slowly, life looked like it was turning up. Until the storm clouds rolled back in. Is Keyz my salvation, or just another chapter in my saga of pain?

Growing up, she learned the hustle that only the streets could teach—gritty, relentless, and real. She chased her dream of marrying young and building a family, but what she never saw coming was the nightmare she’d have to a husband who lied, cheated, and tore her down, one bruise at a time. Between the side chicks, late-night calls from unknown numbers, and endless arguments, Taylen had finally reached her breaking point. After a gut-wrenching divorce, she's ready to reclaim her life, determined to rise from the ashes, believing the worst is finally behind her. Just as she starts putting her life back together, a stranger steps in and shakes up her entire world—opening doors she never thought she'd enter again.

Ace Pierre runs his city with power and confidence, a king among men. Women were never a problem for him; they flocked to his magnetic energy. But real relationships? They weren't part of his game plan. With a baby on the way with his so-called baby mama, situationship, or whatever she is, Kamry, Ace isn’t sure if they're even ready for such a big commitment. Between the trust issues and secrets that linger, Ace does what he can to make it work—until a call from one of his realty companies changes everything. Stepping into a situation he didn't expect, he bumps into Taylen, a woman whose presence alone leaves him breathless and his carefully constructed life in jeopardy.

As their worlds collide, Taylen and Ace find themselves tangled in a whirlwind of unexpected passion, raw emotion, and a connection that neither saw coming. But with old flames, lies, and jealous eyes watching their every move, can they fight against the odds to make love work? Or will the weight of the past and the drama that haunts them prove too much to bear?

Why did I let myself fall for a successful, handsome, yet utterly dangerous man—a genuine menace to society who showed me a softer side he kept hidden from everyone else? Behind closed doors, we shared nights of passionate kisses, intimate pillow talks, laughter that made us forget our struggles, and moments so intense they left marks on our souls. Yet from the start, it was he didn't want love, didn't desire a family, and initially, neither did I.

Sometimes, you dive headfirst into chaos, desperately hoping the story ends differently. Despite every red flag and every screaming instinct telling me to leave, I chose to stay—chasing a love that was never promised.

Now, I'm pregnant, feeling painfully unwanted, and undeniably desperate—craving the love only he can provide, longing for his touch, needing his embrace to feel secure. The truth was there all along, yet I can't stop yearning to be the peace he desperately needs but won’t admit to. Can I somehow convince him that the home he runs from is right here with me, with us?

Being so young, Page hadn’t had much experience with dementia, but she began documenting, in writing and art, her family’s heartbreaking and hilarious experiences. 
As a professional artist, she had often turned to art as a self-prescribed therapy to help deal with life’s trials. This battle was no different. She utilized the elephant as a symbol for dementia, and incorporated sheet music into the paintings because her dad had been a jazz musician. Eventually, Page created 40 paintings that are included in the book. She also began blogging about the range of issues that arose daily as the disease progressed, documenting everything from her own fear of getting dementia, to her dad’s transition to diapers (and the various places he opted to drop his drawers and just “go”), to combatting his compulsions like the need to “clean” the cars with steel wool, to an exploration of how he might have gotten the disease, to finding the right dementia care facility, to the best ways to make him giggle. Page approached the disease from the fresh viewpoint of a younger caregiver. As her blog following grew, so did the suggestions from readers that she turn the blog into a book. After hearing too many horror stories about traditional publishing contracts, she decided to self-publish. She ran a fundraising campaign for her book, Fractured Memories, and presold over 500 copies in less than a month.
“My dad was my best friend. He embraced the ridiculous, looked for the good in people, and mentored and helped people whenever he could. Following his diagnosis, when people asked how he was doing, he’d answer, ‘Not bad for a demented guy.’ He looked for the light hiding amidst the pain. He chose to be very open about what he was going through in the hopes that it would help other people cope with their own diagnosis or a loved one’s diagnosis. Writing this book seemed a fitting way to honor that legacy.” 
Page doesn’t shy away from the ugly, raw emotion of life with dementia, but she also looks for the laughter where it can be found. Rest assured, you will love her father as much as she does when the book is done, and perhaps gain some insight about how to cope with your own loved one’s dementia or how to support a caregiver.

Nikki needs this job to provide for her six-year-old son. She never expected her new boss to be Mateo—the man she secretly adored in high school. He’s charming, flirty, and just as handsome as ever. But she knows better than to believe a man like him would ever want forever with a woman like her.

He’s determined to prove her wrong. She’s convinced he’ll walk away. But love—and a little boy with a shy smile—might just rewrite their story.

He has no control of the saber-toothed tiger inside of him, and now a past that broke his animal is coming after him to finish the job. He’s finding a strange comfort in a sassy beauty who is the glue holding the Warlanders together. Cadence is the daughter of an Alpha, and her animal is tightly under control. Kru secretly admires her, but he knows he will never be a safe bet for a mate. The best he can hope for is friendship, but hanging around the trailer park with Cadence has him wishing for more. His body can’t stop craving the sexy vixen, and his animal is paying way too much attention to her. All he wants is to hide what Damon Daye has saved him from, but Cadence makes it very tempting to share his secrets. Too bad his secrets could cause a catfight that brings war to Damon’s Mountains.

Being a Warlander is pure chaos. Cadence is doing her best to make sure everyone is settling in to the trailer park, but one of the Crew has her attention more than the rest. Kru is witty, and confident, and a monster when he is Changed. That disconnect with his animal has her wanting to figure him out—a very dangerous game with a shifter like him. The closer she gets to him, the more the mysteries unravel, and now she’s in a game of cat-and-mouse that she doesn’t want to end. Kru is a big, dominant, hot, good man with a bad-boy attitude, a talent for making her feel safe, and a deep understanding of what a Crew truly should be. He has her questioning everything. He has warned her that he has a past, but she isn’t prepared for what is barreling toward the mountains she has always called home.

Now, having his brother as his Alpha has his animal riled up and fighting everything. When he sees a woman from his past, he knows she has the ability to understand his history, and that chance meeting dredges up the urge to lean on the fragile human. Sloane has changed in the years she’s been gone from Damon’s Mountains, but those changes intrigue him. She isn’t the woman he thought she was all those years ago…she’s more. On the verge of a war with the Holland Pride, the timing isn’t great for bringing a human potential mate into the picture. She’s kicking up instincts inside of him that could get them both annihilated. The good man in him knows she needs to remain untethered to the Fastlanders and all the trouble the Crew will bring, but the monster in him doesn’t care.

Sloane Middleson has just had her life turned upside down, and now she’s back near her hometown trying to figure out her next step. Captain Walker was the boy she had a crush on all those years ago, but he wasn’t a good match. Now? Captain is different. Bigger. Grittier. More dominant…and in many ways, more frustrating. She can’t stop seeking him out though, and she doesn’t know what is wrong with her. She is drawn to him in ways that make no sense to a logical, responsible woman like her. Bringing him into her life is complicated, to say the least, but sometimes life doesn’t have the best timing. She thought her story was ending, but Captain is showing her that the adventure has just begun.

Even with the upcoming wedding to Verka, things should have gotten calm. For a time, it even looked like it might, giving the family hope. However, Krogga was proving to be a far more dangerous post than they’d thought it would be.

The spies who’d been hounding them had to be dealt with, revealing them to be a few clans from the empire. They’d had to kill all involved, only bringing further trouble when an Imperial investigator arrived to question them. They held strong, and eventually, the investigator left with more than enough evidence of the clans being sanctioned.

The wedding finally arrived, and the family celebrated Verka joining them. Gregory overcame the ritual of the climb up the temple road, including talking Ragnar down. Having married Verka just before the solstice, all of them were looking forward to a week off to enjoy their newest addition.

Sadly, it was right in the middle of the Festival of Krog that Buldoun blundered. Launching an unprovoked and deadly attack, Buldoun might have managed to capture or decimate the city if not for Gregory’s foresight. When the attack was finally thwarted and the Buldounish ships sailed off, the city began to pick itself back up.

The Pettits did their best to help the city, all while wondering what would happen next. More of their family would be arriving during the year, and Krogga would be turning its angry gaze toward Buldoun. There was so much waiting to be settled that anything could happen, and they still had years left on their posting in Krogga.",242367877:4.76:273|237773259:4.68:622|243732978:4.55:523|241386929:4.62:770|243251749:4.77:203|221761781:4.71:1536|238227357:4.62:993|239713764:4.81:623|241384561:4.72:324|243291528:4.6:317|236568919:4.54:604|240327412:4.71:571|241661760:4.55:629|236572491:4.61:561|235718610:4.79:1445|239916610:4.64:1225|234508448:4.53:1612|234398426:4.65:1545|235565988:4.79:262|243011842:4.66:206

He’s coming off a shoulder injury though, and he’s looking for something to keep him motivated to put his body through the strain of bucking in rodeos every week. Hints about his past are making it into the public eye, and the pressure on him is bigger than ever, but when he sees a stranger in the crowd at a rodeo, she just might be the key to turning things around. Raven looks like a tough-girl, but her sweet demeanor has his bull paying attention. He’s falling way too hard, and way too fast, and he doesn’t know her intentions yet. She’s a Hagan, and those shifters are nothing to mess with. Their inner animals are territorial and ill-tempered to say the least, but that only adds to Raven’s mystery. She could be the motivation he needs…or his downfall. Only time will tell.

Raven has a plan: meet the bull shifter who can answer questions about her biological family, and ask him how she can control her animal. Meeting Dead of Winter isn’t easy. He’s in town for a rodeo and signing autographs after he bucks, and what starts as a VIP meet-and-greet turns into a week-long adventure of self-discovery, and falling hard for the man who is teaching her all about herself. Her animal isn’t like his, or any of the rest of the herd though. She’s a lean, mean, human-stomping machine and there’s no controlling her once she’s on the loose. Dead’s options are simple—see the animal and run, or see the potential and push her to be bigger than she ever imagined. Her life is taking a drastic turn, and it’s overwhelming and exhilarating. And now, she just needs to make sure Dead, and all the people he loves, survive her.

Abandoned by her mother as a baby, she’s lived twenty-one years content to drive nails at her dad’s side. Following her father into the world of construction was a natural path, and she took it without a second thought. But a harsh comment about her “butch” appearance sends her on a search for identity.

In every way, the quirky man is her opposite—confident, a people kind of guy, and most importantly, happy. His likable qualities continue to draw her in, and for some reason he keeps coming back to her. But they can’t be more than friends—he’s made that crystal clear. Except for a handful of times…and the confusion is driving her crazy.

FBI Special Agent Autumn Trent is desperate for something to focus on besides the lingering emotional fallout of their last two cases. And the growing distance between her and Aiden Parrish, her supervisor and boyfriend. So when a new case lands on her desk, she jumps at the distraction.

Who knew bloodshed could provide relief?

The case is as gruesomely appalling as it is distracting. Two homeless drug addicts dragged to death by their necks, their bodies throw in the James River. More puzzling still is the discovery of the corpse of another homeless man a month before…killed in the same brutal manner and tossed in dumpster.

These days, the cockpit of her seaplane is the only place Angelica Fielding feels purposeful and in control. When she’s high above the tranquil waters surrounding Sanctuary Island, her spirit is as free as the Lake Huron breeze. If only that peace followed her on the ground, instead of the endless grief she keeps pushed down while focusing on inheriting her uncle’s thriving charter business.

When a face from her past turns up, all that she’s buried deep inside threatens to spill to the surface and destroy everything she’s strived for.

Weary from the relentless demands of his medical career, Colton Brunswick needs a change. Past mistakes have left him empty and numb and he no longer recognises the man in the mirror. He hopes his position as the new doctor on Sanctuary Island will give him the chance to reassess his life and heal his wounded spirit. He’d prescribe a fresh start for anyone else, so why not himself? But starting over is one thing. Confronting his past and dealing with the regret he’s carried over the loss of his best friend for so long is something altogether different. If he can’t forgive himself, how can his best friend’s sister?

As Angelica and Colton navigate the waters of their tragic past, faith might just be the ally they both need.

Ember is thriving both personally and professionally, along with the other descendants of the One True Witch, and life has never smelled sweeter—until the bloom is off the rose, of course.

When a resident known as the Midnight Surfer is found dead on Balefire Beach, the community is shaken. The aging surfer was a fixture in Starry Hollow, albeit an ornery one, and the whole town is eager for Sheriff Nash to solve the case. With more suspects than grains of sand, the sheriff needs all the help he can get, and Ember is more than happy to offer her services.

Meanwhile, Marley falls under the influence of an older friend and begins to test boundaries at home and school, much to Ember’s dismay. The broomstick mama isn’t used to challenging behavior and it seems the only way to hold on is to let go.

Will the gathering dark clouds have a silver lining or will Ember succumb to the dead of night?

While they were guarding against one kidnapping spree, the Veil performed another. But Scarlett has a lead on the captives, and for once, she’s going to be the one delivering trouble rather than receiving it.

The Veil won’t be stopped by just one strike, though. Camus’ plans to control captives and their owners with magical mind control collars could make him unstoppable. All he needs to do is get the collars on, place the servants, and then activate the magic inside them.

Time is ticking away while Scarlett, The Witches on Wheels, and the Spell Riders search for the key lead. 

Scarlett may need a new kind of magic to beat the Veil this time. An elderly witch wants to teach her how to use blood magic to track someone. Is it enough? And does it pose its own threat?

The past year has split the bear shifters into two Clans—the New, and the Old. The Old clings to a barbaric way of life where females are less than, but the New? Biergon the Dead is leading them toward a new reality—one where the females run this new world. Biergon has given them power, and freedom, and support.

Slaughter has lost much to the Old Clan. He has been keeping them in line since, but now there is a female who is trying to kill him. He should be furious, but Tayah the Vicious has his attention. She has her own reasons for hunting Slaughter, and now he is forced to deal with the past and all the things that made him the Destroyer that he is. If anyone can bring him into the light, it’s Tayah…but she will have to pay a huge price to do so.

Tayah the Vicious is in a Clan that makes no sense. The females here pair up because they want to, but Tayah knows that is just weakness. She will never settle down, will never trust a male to be a partner with her. Females run the world now, and Tayah will spend every last breath pushing her friends into the light. But…there is one last link to the old ways of life, and his name is Slaughter. He has done unspeakable things, and he must be stopped. He is creating a war no one can contain, and it’s up to Tayah to put an end to the Legend of Slaughter Mountain. The only problem? He’s much too interesting for his own good. The more she learns of the reasons for his vengeance, the more it makes sense that he would want to bring war to the Clans.

Perhaps Slaughter’s war is exactly what they all need.
Perhaps he can fix the wrong that’s been done to Tayah.
And maybe, just maybe…Slaughter can teach her how to live.

Healing doesn’t come easy to these shifters, especially not to a bear shifter who has been consumed by evil. In this final installment of T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Bears of Slaughter Mountain series, all will be exposed. For Slaughter Mountain, and the ‘evil’ that has protected it for all these years, is not what it seems.

There are a few problems that are keeping him from pursuing her. One, she is a seer coming into her powers, which is equal parts hot, and also terrifying—which is sexy, because Landon, in true Fuller fashion, is attracted to things that scare him. Problem number two? She doesn’t know he exists. She’s gorgeous, has the perfect rack, could chill a man’s blood with a look, and knows big words. She’s the most beguiling, intelligent, and intimidating creature he’s ever seen, and lately, they are being forced into the same territory. When he figures out he can easily fluster her, the game is on, and his inner bear is on the hunt.
Problem number three—Lucia’s most recent vision includes him destroying everything.

Lucia Novak is the daughter of a famous seer, and she has unfortunately inherited the sight. Her unwelcome powers are ruining her life, and to protect others around her, Lucia has withdrawn from the world. She can see what will happen to the people she cares about before it even happens, and trouble is coming for her newly formed Warlander Crew. And in the midst of all that trouble? There is one savagely strong, tall-as-a-house and wide-as-a-barn, dominant, delinquent Fuller brother. Landon is trouble with a capital T, and for some reason, he has his attention set on her, and to be honest, he is proving to be an entertaining distraction. The more she gets to know about the Healer of Damon’s Mountains, the more she thinks she may have misjudged him.

If only Landon wasn’t going to do what she knows he will, perhaps she could let her guard down, but this dominant grizzly shifter has a dark destiny that will burn everything she loves to the ground.

Landon Fuller is her enemy, and she will stop at nothing to protect the mountains she loves, and her heart, from him.

His father has asked him to try to join one of the Crews of Damon’s Mountains. When the new Fastlander Crew starts accepting applicants, Ace puts his name in the hat on a whim.

Ace has been hiding a secret about his lineage since he was a child, and now the Fastlanders are getting way too close for comfort. And to add to the pressure, there’s a human coordinating the Crew’s interview process that has his animal’s attention. At first he thinks his animal is hunting her, but the more he gets to know her, the more he realizes she is important. Corey Gable just might be the glue of the Fastlanders, and she doesn’t even realize her part in the destiny of this Crew. The problem? It’s twofold. One, he cannot under any circumstances bond to a human, and two? His life is in a free fall, and he cannot drag her into what is about to happen. If she wants to live, she’s got to stay human, and stay away from the Fastlanders. And most importantly? She has to stay away from Ace.

Corey Gable has lost someone she loves.

Corey’s cousin, Hallie, has been consumed by her new life with the shifters of Damon’s Mountains, and she’s left Corey behind.

When Corey is roped into helping with the interview process of creating the new Fastlanders Crew, there are definitely some interesting characters who want the invite. One of them is tall, dark, and mysterious, and there’s something about him that keeps drawing her in—but he has big warnings for her. She’s messing with a destiny that could be the end of her life as she knows it. She wants to heed his advice, truly she does, but there’s just something about the mysterious stranger.

Since he was young, he knew he wanted to escape the unfortunate legacy of his people and find something that has always felt just out of reach. Moving to Damon’s Mountains ensured he could be close to other powerful shifters who could inspire him, instead of dragging him back into old habits, but joining the Fastlanders has set him and his animal on a rollercoaster he can’t manage for much longer.

Owen is the only one who can save her now.

Jules Cavanaugh would like nothing better than to settle into midlife, bury her toes in the sand, and sip margaritas with her hot new shifter boyfriend, but that's not what the universe has planned.

As the Mistress of Balance, it's her job to keep the scales of light and dark from tipping, and so far, she's doing a bang-up job. Since she found out she's magical, she's been kidnapped, attacked by a sea serpent, battled an army of Dark Fae, and even fought off biting pixies that make Florida's mosquitos seem tame.

Now, though, she's facing paranormal threats from all directions. She has a spy in her bar, her truce with her witchy sister is over, and an ancient Djinn has made it his mission to take her down. Fortunately, she has a house that provides an unending supply of Advil, an insanely hot Alpha shifter for a boyfriend, and the most dangerous lapdog in existence.

Toss in a gargoyle guard, two hilarious, powerful wizards, and two sassy best friends, and Jules is about to show her enemies just how dangerous underestimating a woman dealing with hot flashes, stray chin hairs, and a boatload of magic can be!

If you like your magic with a side of snarky humor, hellhounds, and rum, you'll love this book.

She would be absolutely fine to never see him again. She’s perfectly happy working in Sweet Water at her family’s auction barn and taking care of an elderly lady who’s keeping her daughter’s two small children. She never even thinks of Thad anymore.

Hardly ever.

Thad doesn’t believe in love at first sight, but he does believe that sometimes a man’s attention gets caught by a good woman and it’s hard to focus on anything else for the next five years. Or something like that.

Finally, because he’s the boss and the boss can take a vacation, he decides to go ahead and take a vacation by getting a ranching job at the same place where Lavender just so happens to be babysitting and helping the elderly woman hold on to her ranch. If he spends a few weeks with Lavender, he’ll realize she’s just like every other woman he knows.

Except she’s not. And a few weeks isn’t nearly long enough to spend with her. But she is going to hate him when she finds out he’s been deceiving her all this time. Unless he really becomes what he’s claimed to be – penniless. Is one woman worth risking everything for?

She’s been quietly grieving a devastating loss. When Finn and Edith reunite in small-town Three Rivers where they grew up together, can their second chance romance provide hope, healing, and the happily-ever-after they both crave?

Finley Ackerman left home ten years ago, determined to figure out who he was and what he wanted his life to be. He’s been serving in the Army, but when the opportunity to get out of intelligence and go home to Three Rivers comes up, Finn jumps at it.

He’s expecting a huge homecoming at Three Rivers Ranch. He’s even expecting the Welcome Home banners draped across Main Street in town. He’s not expecting to run into Edith Baxter literally the moment he gets out of his truck.

Edith is just as surprised to see Finn—decked out in his uniform, no less—as she comes out of her equine therapy appointment at Three Rivers Ranch. But the moment she steps into his arms and welcomes him home, it’s as if choirs of angels start singing.

Perhaps he’s what she needs to finally move past the tragedies life has dealt her. She’s done her best to put her heart back together after the devastating loss of her fiancé a few years ago, and she does that by pouring everything she has into her children’s books and working a small patch of land not far from Finn’s sprawling family operation.

But she’s not whole, and she knows it. He does too, and as Finn and Edith start finding solace in one another, she learns that he carries his own scars. She’s not sure her heart will ever be whole enough to give to another cowboy, and Finn’s not sure exactly what’s next for him or how long he’s actually going to stay in town.

Can Edith and Finn make their second chance into a forever love? Or will life’s paths once again diverge, driving them apart for good?

Over the years, she’s learned to protect herself, not just physically, but emotionally too. Now that she’s almost 40 and surrounded by friends who have families of their own, the yearning to create a happy life for herself has started getting more intense. The biggest obstacle to that life is Leia herself since she’s made a habit of choosing the wrong men just so she won’t be sad when they inevitably go their own way, whether by their own choice or because she’s come up with a crazy story that will help get them out of her life for good.

A chance encounter puts Leia on the defensive, and now it’s up to her to find a way past that and give herself a chance to find the happiness she’s always dreamed of.

Twenty years in prison will change a man in many ways, but at his core, Waylon is still the loyal and trustworthy man he was when he went in. However, the world probably won’t see him that way, but that’s not what bothers him most. He wants more than the life he had before he went to prison. Hopefully, he’ll be able to settle down in Rojo while he looks for that chance.

Even after all these years, it’s in Waylon’s nature to help people in need. When he comes to the rescue of a stranger in the grocery store - not once but twice - it changes the course of his new life forever. Lucky for him, the object of his gallantry is a well-known and well-loved member of one of Rojo’s most prominent families.

Raised in a den with fox pups and taught their trickster ways, she dreams of the wider world. When she finally gets to leave the comfort of Hoshido, she relishes in the sites and sounds and company of others. But it doesn’t take long to learn that everything isn’t as it seems.

Peace has been stolen from the clans of Korugan by tyrannical, power hungry (ahem, OP) ninjas. Can she grow strong enough to face the Ultimate Ninjas? Will she risk it all to return rightful power to the individual clans, as well as honor to her own Fox Clan?

Side-by-side with her best buddies Ninko and Yoko—adorably mischievous fox yokai pups, her adventures take them across the entire seed of Korugan, far away from her familiar home, through treacherous biomes, into impossible battles, and hilarious experiences she’ll never forget.

She may be up against enemies far beyond her age and skill, but they lack one thing she doesn’ the courage to seek justice in the name of her village and family they destroyed.",180603058:4.88:986|198971142:4.88:933|199456934:4.88:859|201582481:4.87:823|203172013:4.83:860|210642087:4.88:758|181341518:4.81:619|147979500:4.87:244|200987907:4.88:263|198532536:4.82:261|206084282:4.85:790|180793929:4.85:493|208999998:4.89:808|123284549:4.85:1090|61277279:4.87:558|124119258:4.74:248|60675369:4.83:1546|213501271:4.89:739|237977965:4.87:350|240548959:4.9:280

His latest heist? Foolproof. The part where a superhero showed up and he got yeeted into a world of magic, monsters, and medieval nonsense?

Yeah. Not part of the plan.

Now, Xander is stranded in a land where dragonkin rule and magic is real. Which sounds kind of cool, except his high-tech gadgets are toast and humans are low man on the food chain.

But Xander didn’t become a genius by giving up. If the laws of physics don’t always apply, fine. He’ll make new ones. With a little rune magic, some serious upgrades, and a dangerously snarky attitude, he’s about to change the game.

If you love the snark of Iron Man, the genius schemes of Artemis Fowl, and the fast-paced adventure of Alcatraz vs. The Evil Librarians, you’ll devour Evil Genius!",233888920:4.86:397|231644460:4.86:378|237977965:4.87:350|240548959:4.9:280|242376874:4.9:230|223761108:4.86:93|223126191:4.91:530|222588388:4.89:94|221893331:4.87:478|231434892:4.55:278|215607811:4.88:59|222239196:4.91:102|25603089:4.58:516|219637210:4.83:580|242621201:4.94:78|206084282:4.85:790|216692539:4.88:714|236893223:4.87:166|61276913:4.88:585|60675369:4.83:1546

He’d gone from being a private military contractor with his squad in the Middle East to being isekai-ed into a different multiverse.

He lost his friends and his lover, Selda, in the same hour of his arrival, sparking in him the mission to kill every single Entoma he could to repay them for his loss. Luckily, an alien named Crish arrived to help Zander adjust to his new reality.

His first few days were a chaotic mess as he tried to adapt, but it was his first day on board the ship Fractured Dreams that Zander discovered what his new life would be. He was one of the lucky a person whose body accepted an AI of Antecedent technology. His AI, however, was special, taking on the memories and persona of his former lover, Selda Engel.

With Crish’s and AI Selda’s help, Zander came up with a mad plan to displace the pilot leader, Shivatin the Rakshasa, and take over that position. He had experience staying alive as a mercenary, and used that to forge the fractured crew into a new, cohesive whole.

As he was finally taking on the mantle of leader, Shivatin led a mutiny to take the ship from the captain and to kill Zander. The Rakshasa had no clue what he’d unleashed in doing so; Zander led his new team in a repelling action, killing the invading boarders, then pushing on to the bridge to take out Shivatin.

Veldiami, the captain of Fractured Dreams, took it one step further, boarding the other ship that helped in the mutiny to claim as salvage. It only took killing four— including the ship’s captain— to secure it as loot.

Left on the other ship, the Righteous, to guide it to the nearest galactic hub, Zander made a deal with the remaining crew. They used the FTL drive to reach the hub that day, meaning Zander would find himself alone on MX Hub for two days before Fractured Dreams and her crew arrived.

What trouble could a Human— completely out of his depth in a new universe and on an alien space station— get into before his crewmates arrived?",239713764:4.81:623|217224162:4.72:1085|221234394:4.69:830|230200171:4.74:752|216293555:4.62:1176|215155562:4.58:1410|198812221:4.5:3887|236004527:4.63:1009|233954649:4.7:485|239916610:4.64:1225|218623204:4.64:2070|227805792:4.52:1218|199143280:4.57:2623|207596721:4.67:1039|217308138:4.61:1948|213076829:4.6:2653|203502111:4.52:2795|201857408:4.6:2641|216235135:4.63:2189|211055959:4.61:2318

With all his money, his rugged good looks, and his ability to say all the right things, Faith has no chance against Blaze Young's charms. But she’s his complete opposite, and she just doesn't see how they can be together...

...so she ends things with him.

But Faith Cromwell can't seem to stay away from Blaze. Rather, they keep getting put together by fate, God, or just plain bad luck. She's not sure which.

As the owner of Hole in One, a struggling doughnut dessert truck, Faith feels married to her business. And she's minding that business the day of a charity food truck rally, which Blaze shows up to.

Blaze Young doesn't know why the pretty redhead thinks the way she does. Of course, he's never been one to try to figure out women all that much. He's focused on being a single dad, a back surgery survivor, and rekindling his faith. Oh, and his enormous family keeps him enveloped in drama all the time.

But Faith - he'd really like to figure out how to keep her in his life too. He is at the charity rally, but not of his own choice. If he'd have known that's where his ex-in-laws were going for their Thanksgiving desserts, he'd have begged out of the visit.

But he's here now, and they're taking donations at the door. Fine. He has billions in the bank and he quickly scribbles out a check.

He has no idea that the Lord has once again orchestrated it just-so for him to come face-to-face with the lovely Faith Cromwell...and for her to win part of his donation.

But what looks like perfection soon leads to problems, the likes of which none would have ever expected. 
Follow them as they live, grow, learn, and oftentimes, make mistakes, while never losing sight of what matters the most in the world. Walk with them as they traverse through a life that’s not devoid of turmoil or heartache. 
These four stories prove that no matter what life throws in their way -- pain, suffering, devastating illness, love, loss, or tragedy – the Amish King sisters are, above all else, a family worth rooting for and a series worth reading time and time again. 

Book 1: The Choice 
Baptized into the Amish faith, Emma finds her heart divided between family, community and forbidden love for an Englischer man. 

Book 2: Faith 
Three Amish women, three tests of faith. Will they persevere in their love for Gott or will their hardships harden them to Gott’s benevolence? 

Book 3: Heartache 
The King Sisters have come a long way, but life isn’t done throwing obstacles in their path. While Rachel must find the man who will make her happy, Emma must overcome the daunting risks to her unborn child. 

Book 4: Torment 
The King Sisters have faced their fair share of troubles, but up until this moment, their worries have never been greater. One longs for a family of her own; another is desperate for much-needed change; and the other faces the biggest challenge of her life. Will the King Sisters pull through their greatest challenges and finally find the peace and grace they’ve worked so hard to achieve?

Rebecca Lapp has built her life on perfect order. Since losing her mother at twelve, she's kept her Amish family together through meticulous planning and unwavering devotion to tradition. But when a violent storm forces her to seek shelter with Jacob Zook—whose innovative ideas have always raised eyebrows in their community—her carefully constructed world begins to shift.

As drought threatens their farms and livelihoods, Jacob's revolutionary irrigation system offers hope—and ignites controversy. Rebecca finds herself drawn not just to Jacob's kindness and ingenuity, but to his vision of honoring tradition while embracing thoughtful change. Yet their growing attraction becomes a lightning rod for those who fear any departure from the old ways.

When sabotage destroys Jacob's work and false accusations drive him from the community, Rebecca must choose between the security of conformity and a love that challenges everything she thought she believed. Armed with nothing but her mother's hidden wisdom and her own newfound courage, she'll discover that sometimes the strongest faith grows from questioning, and the deepest traditions are found not in rigid rules but in the courage to love authentically.

But with enemies determined to destroy their future and a community divided by fear, Rebecca and Jacob must prove that innovation and tradition can strengthen rather than threaten each other—before it's too late.

In this sweeping Amish romance of faith, courage, and unexpected love, discover how two hearts can find harmony even when their worlds seem impossibly apart.",236293098:4.71:452|235071518:4.65:241|234736494:4.7:290|233275798:4.67:294|236170334:4.66:204|236639143:4.69:162|234142543:4.67:205|235828113:4.6:199|234483727:4.62:312|235761169:4.66:125|232435625:4.63:348|234254623:4.71:290|231349574:4.59:373|236639857:4.61:140|232917497:4.69:224|230841207:4.77:202|239426403:4.73:143|235828895:4.58:172|236637312:4.66:140|231764950:4.57:204

Sarah Lapp has come into her own as her community's trusted healer, but her skills are put to the ultimate test when Daniel Beiler returns from the English world. He is not the boy who left, but a man haunted by the suffering he witnessed in a veterans' hospital, his spirit wounded in ways no herbal tonic can mend.

As Sarah is drawn to Daniel’s quiet pain, a new crisis threatens to fracture their community. A legal loophole gives English developers a claim on an ancestral farm, bringing the threat of worldly courts and lawyers to their peaceful way of life . The elders preach a return to strict tradition, seeing Daniel's trauma as a dangerous English contamination . Their judgment causes Daniel to push Sarah away, determined to protect her from his own brokenness.

Now, Sarah must prove what she knows in her healer's the deepest wounds are not a source of shame, but a source of strength. She believes the very experiences that shattered Daniel are what have given him the unique wisdom to heal their divided community. Can she help him see the purpose in his pain before he retreats into darkness for good? And can a man who believes his past makes him a threat find the courage to become the very leader his people need?

Shame Wears My Name
 is a slow-burning psychological novel set in the fragile spaces of childhood and memory , a haunting meditation on what we carry, what we conceal, and how we learn to perform just to survive.

What begins as the quiet tale of a withdrawn boy soon morphs into something far more 

A portrait of homes where words are withheld,

Rooms that remember,

And a child’s search for meaning in a world that forgot to ask.

This is not a book about loud traumas.
It’s about the ones that never had a name.
The ones that pass down silently ,
through glances, gestures, absences.

🖤 A boy who reads to feel seen
🖤 A house too full of warmth that arrives too quickly
🖤 A silence that doesn’t vanish , it mutates
🖤 A self that watches, performs, learns

Walking toward me with arms extended, was the most loving, kindest man I had ever seen. With a sparkle in His eyes and a broad smile on His lips, He invited me to come for a walk with Him. Immediately I followed, leaving those gathered around me. Donna Rigney’s exceptionally vivid and unforgettable book showcases her unique relationship with Jesus through a host of heavenly experiences. At the tender age of seven, her divine encounters with Jesus later lead her into a perceptive spiritual relationship, propelling her to fulfill her passion for Christ. Jesus guides her into the depths of hell and the peaks of heaven through intensely detailed visions. Donna’s exceptionally vivid portrayals of the excruciating screams of tormented sinners and the moving testimonials of spiritually pure heavenly inhabitants create an unforgettable read. “Yes, you have walked the corridors of heaven, the trenches of hell and saw the glories and riches I have prepared for those who love and serve Me, along with the horrors and cruelty the enemy has stored up for those who serve him. Spiteful and filled with malice are the benefits the evil one has prepared as a reward for his followers. If My children knew the truth, very few would freely choose to follow Satan, or embrace his sinful ways.”Donna Rigney’s memorable spiritual journey balances visions of heaven and hell with compelling messages of faith and forgiveness. Donna eloquently expresses the words of Jesus, giving you the tools to forgive and overcome your most painful of wounds. Your faith will be broadened as you pray for peace and place your pains in the palms of Jesus; you will overcome temptation as you recall valuable biblical references and timeless biblical prophecies. You will overcome being chained by sin, temptation, anger, wrath, fear, bitterness and spiritual emptiness; you will win the battle against Satan’s influence.",19024778:4.83:60

Fraternal quadruplets, my sisters are statuesque, beautiful, and healthy, while I'm short, overweight, and the only carrier of the breast cancer gene. Growing up in the Florida mafia, we took our troubling childhood and used it as the driving force behind Goldman Girls Realty and a life as far removed from our sperm donor as possible.
Now, if only our love lives could be as successful.
After a disastrous date that leaves me frustrated with men and unsatisfied in every sense of the word, I run into a man who changes my entire life during the course of a very pleasurable elevator ride. Am I ready for everything that comes with a man of the Kosher Nostra when I swore I would never be with anyone associated with the mafia? I can fight my own battles, whether the enemy lives within my body or sends his minions to North Carolina to drag me back kicking and screaming, but Ezra, his family, and their friends from New York make it clear they might not be on the right side of the law, but they are on the right side of those they love.
We stand proud, the Goldman Girls and the army of the Kosher Nostra.

After using his elite skills to acquire an ultra-rare magical ring in his favorite fantasy adventure video game, Milo wakes up to find a real ring on his finger—and it gives him extraordinary abilities from the game in real life!

Now, Milo can see “stats” floating over people’s heads, use magical spells and weapons, and even level up. But Milo learns his new powers come with a catch—evil creatures from the game are spawning into the real world, and Milo is the only one who can stop them.

To succeed, Milo will have to defeat powerful enemies, acquire amazing new items, and boost his wavering confidence. But as he’s about to discover, being a hero in the real world is a lot harder than being one in a video game. Especially since he has a limited number of Health Points—and when they run out there are no extra lives.

Kids 8-12, reluctant readers, and adults will love joining Milo on his quest to level up from gamer to real-life hero. With non-stop action and laugh-out-loud humor, this fun new series from bestselling author R.L. Ullman unlocks an incredible reward—it gets kids to put down their screens and pick up a book!",233788369:4.81:206|240548959:4.9:280|219637210:4.83:580|220740007:4.91:200|213860639:4.84:268|219396031:4.87:243|213501271:4.89:739|236532191:4.84:158|223126191:4.91:530|200278334:4.89:255|222350296:4.86:173|228015786:4.87:154|216692539:4.88:714|221893331:4.87:478|223876974:4.92:191|60675369:4.83:1546|233888920:4.86:397|237977965:4.87:350|218063710:4.86:245|217222815:4.8:133

Della, the protagonist, is haunted by the memory of her late husband, Seth, which leads to a surreal encounter with him in the form of a ghost in a dream, and it appears to her as if he never left. He warns her of impending danger and insists she keep Bryce, a close FBI friend of his, nearby—a request that tangles the past with the present.

As Della navigates the complexities of her emotions and the mystery surrounding Seth's message, she finds herself at the center of another troubling puzzle—the death of Clint Rogers, the chairman of the Winter Festival, a huge event in Clover, the small Ozark town where Della lives. Clint, known for his dislike of guns, is found dead in what initially appears to be a suicide. However, as Della delves deeper into the facts surrounding his death, the truth becomes murkier. Was Clint's death really self-inflicted, or is there a more sinister force at play in the seemingly tranquil town of Clover?

Balancing her personal grief and the growing sense of unease, Della becomes an unwitting detective, piecing together clues that lead her through a labyrinth of relationships, secrets, and hidden motives. From conversations with Clint's grieving family to interactions with his ex-wife and contentious Winter Festival committee members, Della uncovers a tapestry of small-town intrigue and resentments.

Tevye

My life with the Kosher Nostra is chaos...but it's a chaos that I thrive in. Money, violence, women, and sarcasm. About a year and a half ago, the consequences of my lifestyle caught up with me, dropping a sickly 5 month old baby boy on my doorstep. His mother is gone, and I'm left trying to navigate a world filled with doctor's appointments, constant monitoring, and stress. I have a son, but I'm not meant to be a father. My twin sister and I are not like other people. We are detached, cold, calculating. We make the difficult decisions that the softer members of our family cannot. And I've lived that way for almost 30 years, but my father's disappointment and my mother's constant nagging drive me to a support group for help.
And it changes my life irrevocably and completely.
Dammit, I hate it when my mom is right.

Tovah

My twin Tevye has always operated under the assumption that he and I do not feel. We don't emote. Our souls are black and our hearts are made of ice. I know differently. Always have. But I ain't telling him...he'll figure it out on his own, the schmuck.
In the meantime, I'm living life on my terms, not a single regret...until I purposefully put myself in the line of fire and get a nifty new hole in my upper chest as a result. While I'm out cold, my secrets come to light.
And it changes my life irrevocably and completely.
Dammit, it turns out I do have one regret...not coming clean earlier.

""I created these original pieces of angel art because when I needed to find images of angels for presentations, I found precious few that I could actually use. My knowledge of angels and thier demeanor and appearance compelled me to create images that carried a sense of God's presence and glory. Angels are kind yet powerful, they are faithful and fearless, they are noble and self-sacrificing, they are often overwhelming in their presence yet have a compassion and grace about them. They reflect the attributes of God. They carry His glory as they are always in His presence. It was my desire to create a representation of angels that appeared like that description.

Parental In this comic, there are some deaths, but it's all done in a very stupid, cartoony way. There's also a character whose face turns into a butt, but you don't see the butt.

As soon as he could, Zander decided to find work as a military contractor. The company he’d badgered for a job eventually hired him, earning him the nickname “Badger.” While most people dropped out of the lifestyle after a few years, Zander had found a place that felt right to him.

A decade in, he’d even found a couple of friends who stayed on with him. One was Devin Smith, the heavy weapons specialist for the squad and a proud Texan. Another was Selda Engel, their tech specialist. She’d slowly transitioned from a friend to a friend-with-benefits, but even that had started to become more.

Things in Misty Hollow are bad.

So bad, in fact, that we’ve left the Hollow to seek shelter from Swamp Thing in the freezing cold of the Faerie land of Winter.

Now, you might wonder why we’re seeking refuge in Winter, which is currently ruled by the evil would-be queen, Janara, and you’d be right to ask.

Unfortunately, Fox Aspen, otherwise known as Prince Reynard of the Autumn Court, was nearly fatally wounded by Swamp Thing. In his weakened state, the only portal he could open was to Winter.

So, here we are.

If I hoped being in Faerie would somehow help Fox heal, that’s simply wishful thinking. The truth is, Fox’s condition is worsening before my eyes. As someone who works on healing others, I feel utterly helpless because I can’t seem to do anything to help him.

Not only that, but I’m painfully aware that my feelings for him run deeper than I realized. That’s a difficult reality to face—not only because I don’t know if Fox will survive, but also because I’m breaking the heart of another man—my best friend, Thorn.

But matters of the heart will have to wait, because soon we find ourselves prisoners of the enemy in an enemy land, and Fox is our only hope for escape to the safety of Haven Hollow.

An ancient crystal, the heart of balance, is shattered, and with it, the kingdom crumbles. Chaos spreads. Hope fades. Yet whispers of a prophecy remain—of one who will rise to restore what was lost.

Fourteen-year-old Devin Reelms finds his life altered when his destiny is revealed to restore the fallen realm. Thrown from the life he knew, he is forced into the unknown. Among exiles, he finds refuge. They see what he cannot—a power buried deep within him. A destiny he cannot escape.

The search begins. A relic must be reclaimed before it is lost forever. Led by a clue to the forest, where a cursed being awaits, bound by unfinished magic, he speaks an ancient language, and the spell shatters. A guardian awakens! But the shadows grow bolder!

Returning home, he finds only devastation. Trust turns to fear. Loyalty becomes accusation. Shackles bind where once there was safety. But fate does not forget.

Upon release, he seeks his lost allies, only to find them vanished. Seeking answers, he lands up at a mystical garden - where he meets mystical beings and finds hope. There was sign of light ! but the war is closer than ever. He has no choice but to fight. Captured. Dragged into darkness. Brought before the enemy.

Engineer Samantha Reed's perfectly ordered world explodes the night golden light erupts from her hands. Across the city, artist Connor Blake watches impossible shadows flow from his sculptures, defying every law of physics. Neither understands that these abilities mark them as living echoes of souls who died 150 years ago—souls who sacrificed themselves to save reality itself.

Now reality is breaking again.
Cosmic forces write aurora patterns across daylight skies. Reality storms tear through populated sectors. And the zealous Williams organization deploys weapons designed to destroy souls so completely that no form of existence—not even reincarnation—would survive.

But Samantha and Connor are more than just targets.
They're the key to completing a restoration that was interrupted a century and a half ago. As shared dreams and inexplicable compulsions draw them together, they discover their connection transcends this lifetime—and that their growing love might be the only force powerful enough to heal wounds carved into the fabric of existence itself.

The hunt is closing in. Reality won't wait. And some bonds are stronger than death.
Margaret Carter, guardian of forbidden historical knowledge, races to reach them before the Williams assassins strike. Emergency coordinator Nina Reyes struggles to protect civilians as magical disasters escalate beyond all containment. And deep in classified archives, evidence emerges that everything the magical authorities believe about unified consciousness—and the couple who wields it—is catastrophically wrong.

In this breathtaking sequel to The Broken Magic, two souls separated by lifetimes must choose between individual survival and cosmic salvation. Their victory heals the broken reality around them, letting them become guides for a restored world while keeping both their love and their lives..

Perfect for readers who loved The Ten Thousand Doors of January, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, and The Priory of the Orange Tree.

– Our Legacy, by Dael ap Owain

And Earth wept.

Some claim a legacy, once sworn and attested, shall last as long as memory binds it to the living. Others hold, the need for the living is moot. A legacy thus sworn binds the very soul to its course. Binds it into eternity if necessary.

Amidst the ashes and ruin of invasion, with his world crushed beneath the iron heel of the Krîll legions, Earth's last druid swears an oath to lead humanity's salvation.

And so is born the age of Dael's Legacy.

A desperate remnant of humanity holds fast. High amongst the windswept crags of Cymru (Wales), where once the druids worshiped their gods, they prepare to leave earth and all they know. They follow the last druid across the maelstrom divide of space and time to the heart of their destruction, to Krîl-lôc.

It is the year 462 anno Domini and the Roman Empire lies in bloody ruin beneath the Krîll legions’ steel. Indeed across the whole of Terra, verdant mother to mankind, the earth cries for her dead. Hope lies in ashes. And yet . . .

Dael ap mystic, warrior, sorcerer and seer, raised by druids, trained by Myrddin, and barely returned alive from the mystery-shrouded Cloud Kingdoms beyond the Eastern horizon. Now in command of eldritch powers long lost to the Western World, he will match himself against Drägorîsh, High Shaman to the Krîll Empire. Here he begins his fight to undo the horror unleashed across Terra, and mankind’s very existence rests in the balance of Dael’s gambit.

Bound within a prophesy’s doom, this is a tale of two ages, the pledge that spans them, and of two worlds woven tightly into a legacy’s tapestry. A legacy wrought in love and desperate hope, in sacrifice and courage against the ruin of despair.",230293544:4.98:43|57373649:4.96:23

In the world of international espionage, nothing is what it appears to be, and Chase must learn this deadly lesson time after time as he battles not only the unrelenting environment but also the unseen forces behind what may prove to be the final battle he will ever live to fight.

Hold on to your frozen seat as the unthinkable tragedy that calls the team to the Arctic proves to be only the tip of the treacherous iceberg. Unimaginable global consequences, terror of unrivaled magnitude, and diabolical forces bent on unleashing ultimate hell on Earth force Chase and his team to dive deep inside themselves and claim the burning fortitude to drive their swords into the hearts of the enemy before they can deliver their crushing blow against the core of humanity.

Sure, his club brothers were dropping left and right into marital bliss, but he hadn’t thought he’d be lucky enough to have what they had. Meeting Lorelei and her young son, Zavier, had changed that.

Talon would stop at nothing to ensure his new family and the one he planned to grow with Lorelei were protected, no matter the cost.

And add in a cousin who has a huge crush on a rodeo star best friend with some insta-love action at Christmas and you have sweet romance overload.

One grumpy brother needs help to plan a party he doesn't want to be involved with. So he brings in a high class party planner from the city to handle it all. Sparks fly when she uses her sunny disposition to try to win him over to her big ideas.

Another brother unexpectedly runs into his high school sweetheart soon after she returns to town after years away. She's still mad at him for cheating on her when she was miles away in college. He doesn't understand why she doesn't want to be friends again. To say she's insulted would be an understatement.

Yet another cowboy brother is boss to the ranch hands. The lone woman in his crew works harder than any of the men. Life hasn't been kind to her, and neither is her boss. Against his will, he starts to admire the woman but he'd rather take a bullet than let her know. Once he realizes what was right in front of him, he may have ruined the best thing that's ever happened to him before he gets a chance to let her know.

And finally, the youngest brother comes home after years in school becoming a veterinarian. When he meets the woman his family is raving about, he can't warm up to her. He overheard her say something nasty about one of his brothers and he can't get past it. She knows he hates her and when she tries to find out why, he walks away. There seems to be no way these two will ever get along.

But that's not all... A cousin who's all grown up now comes to town for Christmas and comes face to face with the rodeo star she's idolized for years. She embarrassed herself on the dance floor and is sure her chance with her crush is destined to remain a wish. But an ugly sweater competition might pave the way for a fresh start. There's always a little magic at Christmas!

It all happens on a ranch in Big Sky Country. A ranch nestled in the valley with an amazing mountain view. Who wouldn't fall in love in a place like this?

Khloe Moore has secrets. She came to Fallport, Virginia, under false pretenses, only intending to stay for a short while. Over a year later, she’s found the town has everything she’s ever wanted, including friends, a supportive community, and a boss she kinda wants to smack—sometimes with her lips, sometimes with her hand. But when Raiden’s beloved dog is in serious medical danger, all of Khloe’s secrets come spilling out when she risks her privacy to save him. 

Since leaving the Coast Guard, Raiden Walker has lived a quiet life as the town librarian. But he has secrets of his own. Horrors from his last mission in the military. Torments he endured as a kid. What he does in his basement every Friday night… It’s easier to keep his head down and avoid tight connections, even with the men he spends time with on the Eagle Point Search and Rescue team. His four-legged search partner is his best friend. And when his bloodhound’s life is in peril, the last person he expects to save him is Raid’s equally standoffish library employee.

Khloe and Raiden never thought they’d find the one thing they’d always longed for in each other—a loving partner. They’d sniped at one other for so long, once they stopped trying to hide their true selves, they were blindsided by their connection.

Settling into their newfound relationship is exciting…but hardly smooth sailing. Both have skeletons in their closets that aren’t content to stay put. On top of that, a member of their community is doing his best to discredit them both. They’ll have to fight to build a life together in the small town they consider home. And it will take each and every one of their friends—people only too happy to accept them exactly as they are—to ensure they get their happy ending.

** Searching for Khloe is the seventh and final book in the Eagle Point Search & Rescue Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.

Still on bereavement leave and dreading her upcoming birthday—a byproduct of the kidnapping and murder of her best friend in high school—Detective Charli Cross doesn’t feel much like celebrating. She’d much prefer being called in to investigate a reported homicide at a neighborhood playground. Until she realizes the young woman murdered was the nanny of the four-year-old son of a wealthy business mogul and a federal judge.

And the boy is missing.

Believing the motive to be about money or a past or future case, Charli and the rest of the Savannah Police Department anticipate a ransom demand. But none is forthcoming.
When another murder and possible kidnapping occurs, with no similarities to the first victims, Charli fears they’re missing a critical piece of the puzzle. And without it, more children may be in harm’s way.

FBI Special Agents Stella Knox and Hagen Yates are closer than ever to tracking down the one criminal they want to bring to justice more than any other—Joel Ramirez, the dirty FBI agent who ordered the deaths of their fathers. But one horrifying case has bled into the next since Stella moved to Nashville’s Violent Crimes Unit. This time, it’s a shooting in broad daylight near a jewelry store. An apparent robbery.

Except the victim, a two-bit gold trader, is tied to a corruption case in Miami. And the killer didn’t take anything. Not the bag of gold jewelry on the victim. Not the twenty thousand dollars cash in his pocket. And nothing from the jewelry store.

It doesn’t make sense.

When another gold dealer connected with a real estate development in Miami turns up dead, Stella and Hagen take their investigation to Florida. Stolen gold, high-stakes investments, and a shocking connection that hits a little too close to home for Stella intertwine in a web of murder and deceit.

A laugh out loud Cozy Mystery by New York Times, USA TODAY, & Wall Street Journal bestseller Addison Moore. A cruise ship cozy mystery!

Includes RECIPE!

Ransom and I are finally setting sail on our much-anticipated post-wedding getaway, and I’ve promised myself no distractions. Just sun, sea, and some solid alone time with the man of my dreams. But when fate—and by fate, I mean my husband—has to step back into vessel security duty, that plan sinks faster than a badly constructed sandcastle.

With Ransom otherwise occupied, I decide to spend my days sipping mocktails and lounging with my octogenarian besties, Bess and Nettie. At least that’s the plan until I hear about the true crime podcast enthusiast group onboard—an entire crowd of amateur sleuths just like me, solving mysteries for fun. You better believe I’m chomping at the bit to join their merry band of clue-chasers.

But when Bess, Nettie, and I stumble upon a real-life murder victim, the ship’s carefree vibes take a hard turn into dangerous waters. Suddenly, the true crime junkies are trading theories like poker chips, everyone’s a suspect, and the killer might be hiding in plain sight—blending in with the group that ironically lives for murder.

The stakes have never been higher, the suspects never wilder, and if I don’t solve this case fast, “happily ever after” might turn into “til death do us part” sooner than I’d like.

Because love may be in the air… but so is a killer.

If I thought the first half of my life was a bumpy ride, I’d better buckle up because I’m about to go over the hill and off the rails.

My name is Trixie Troublefield Baxter, and I live on a cruise ship. My days are filled with exciting shore excursions, nonstop buffets, and ceaseless games of bingo—can life get any better than this? But then there’s that body.

As we get older and encounter experiences, we suffer failures and setbacks and events beyond our control begin to determine our destiny.

His challenges dealing with a HIV positive needlestick as a doctor in a period where there was no cure, becoming a prisoner of Saddam Hussein while visiting Halabja before the outbreak of the Gulf War, and smuggling cars in order to fund his way thorough medical school when Margaret Thatcher's new government policy deprived him of his educational grant. Thankfully, he never developed AIDS and he left Iraq to pursue his dreams of becoming a Flying Doctor. he tells us that when giving up on your dreams is tempting, that is the time when you need to pursue them more than ever.

Part travelogue, part thriller, part celebrity tell-all, the memoir is a whirlwind of adventure and a fascinating insight into the colourful life of Dr Patrick Treacy.

Cosmetic doctor Patrick Treacy grew up in rural Northern Ireland during The Troubles. Determined to become a doctor, he raised money for medical school in Dublin by smuggling cars from Germany to Turkey. He studied biochemistry at Queens University Belfast and medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons. While working in a Dublin hospital, he was accidentally jabbed with a needle from an HIV patient. He took blood test after blood test for many years until he was confirmed negative. Initially overwhelmed by the experience, he moved to New Zealand, away from everyone who knew what he was going through: his girlfriend and his colleagues. Thus, he began a peripatetic existence, working as a doctor around the world. In Saddam Hussein’s Baghdad, Treacy was arrested and imprisoned, spending days wondering whether he was going to be hanged as a spy. He worked as a ship’s surgeon in California and with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia. On returning to Dublin, Treacy set up the Ailesbury Clinic where he pioneered the emergent field of cosmetic dermatology, championing treatments regarding the use of botulinum toxin and dermal fillers. His award-winning research brought him numerous international accolades and many celebrity patients, including the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson, who came flocking to his door.

Central to this memoir is Treacy’s personal journey: his efforts to escape the conflict of The Troubles, coping with the fear that he may have contracted HIV, getting over his lost love and surviving the crippling Irish recession. Most of all, it gives us a fascinating insight into his award-winning research on the influence of Botox ® on the brain and how he developed protocols to reverse the damage being done to patient’s faces as a result of the complications of dermal fillers.",223599148:4.95:22|227892458:5.0:19|221594721:4.94:18|198665276:5.0:25|220194389:5.0:55

Country Cottage Mysteries is a USA TODAY bestselling series!

My name is Bizzy Baker, and I can read minds—not every mind, not every time but most of the time and believe me when I say it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.

It’s fall in Cider Cove, the air is crisp, the leaves are falling, and a killer is on the loose. The Country Cottage Inn is playing host to a thriller convention and we couldn't be more excited. We’re also hosting a small fall festival that blossoms into an all-out war once my feisty sister and Georgie take over. And that thriller convention? It turns out a killer has decided to thrill us with their presence. Once one of the authors turns up dead on the grounds, I’m more than motivated to hunt down the perpetrator. As if a killer on the loose wasn’t enough, my brother and his wife are about to have their baby. It’s chaos on every front. Fall in Cider Cove is proving to be deadly.

Bizzy Baker runs the Country Cottage Inn, has the ability to pry into the darkest recesses of both the human and animal mind, and has just stumbled upon a body. With the help of her kitten, Fish, a mutt named Sherlock Bones and an ornery yet dangerously good looking homicide detective, Bizzy is determined to find the killer.

The Country Cottage Inn is known for its hospitality. Leaving can be murder.

Walking that hazy line between his day job and his club isn’t an easy one for Wrecker. After all, there aren’t a whole lot of men who were both semi-outlaw bikers and cops. He likes to think he has the best of both worlds and until he meets a certain sexy therapist, he’s been happy with it. It’s a balancing act, but one he can manage. However, once he lays his eyes on Adara, he’s been wanting something else, her.

Only she isn’t making that easy for him. He’s spent months trying to get her to even let him get to the point of a date, let alone anything more. Then fate seems to step in and he gets her to agree to try to have a relationship, which has him over the moon. A relationship with her is something beautiful and sane in the middle of a daunting task. The task of finding out who might be murdering men in Tenillo and making it look like accidents or natural causes. Wrecker’s gut tells him it’s murder, even if the evidence doesn’t.

As if that isn’t enough, he has to deal with threats to Adara and her patients. He thinks they’re navigating everything just fine until his world is upended. He doesn’t know what to do. Can he reconcile his two halves yet again?

Adara

Coming to Tenillo hasn’t been an easy decision for Adara. There are things she rather forget, but life isn’t letting her. Only knowing she’s helping people in need makes it bearable. That and a certain hot biker cop who won’t seem to take no for an answer. She knows she shouldn’t let him get close. It’ll only end in heartache and disaster, but she can’t fight her feelings any longer.

Wrecker opens her eyes and body to many things, as well as her mind. He’s in this for the long haul. He wants her for more than a fun time. He wants forever and there’s nothing she rather give him than that. It’s something she never thought she would have. Only there’s danger and secrets that can destroy both of them. Will he ever forgive her if he finds out?

She’s facing down irate, crazy, and traumatized patients as she tries to build a life with the man she’s come to love. What will she do when the secrets in Tenillo are revealed, and she’s left out in the cold? Will Wrecker be ensnared enough to do the right thing, if not the legal thing? Will she be able to let him all the way in to see the woman she really is?

The first time he catches her attention, he’s been assigned to hunt her down and throw away the
key. All she did was steal someone else’s child. Well, embryo, that is. What Kobe doesn’t know,
though, is the man that hired him is up to no good, and she has no other choice but to run without
looking back.

From that moment on, she spends the rest of her spare time running away from him while also
digging into every nook and cranny of his personal life, finding every weakness he has and
utilizing it any way she needs to keep herself one step ahead of him.

Only one day, when she goes to do her usual snooping, she finds out that not only is her favorite
person in trouble, but he’s also in need of her help.

Too bad it takes her years to find that help.

Her next step is to break him out of the pokey prison-break style.

If she knew he’d go without question, she very well might have.

It didn’t take a genius to know when someone was stalking you. The signs were all there, and
they eventually pointed right at Folsom.

When he figures it out, he plans to confront her and maybe address the silent sexual tension

However, right when he’s ready to admit to himself that she might be the one—daughter who
intimidates the hell out of him or not—she up and disappears for a year.

In that year, he spends every waking moment searching for her.

And eventually he finds her, confronts her, and is hit in the face with the secrets she’s kept from
him for years.

One of which is a big one.

his heart, just like her mom—is the very abducted child from his one and only unsolved case.",175748923:4.59:1310

When Wes and Max met Damaris, a co-worker of their new sister-in-law, they tried to resist their instant attraction. It wouldn’t do to hurt the relationship they were building with Quinn’s new wife by pursuing her best friend.

Lucy Aveline’s ex has a knack for making her feel small and helpless. She’d avoid him entirely, but he still owns a piece of her heart in the form of the pets he purchased for her but kept for himself. She visits Rosie and Jasmine when she can, vows to avoid another controlling boyfriend by staying single, and focuses on her large animal veterinary practice. Or that’s the plan until some longtime family friends attempt to set her up with former rodeo star Hollis Price. Lucy convinces them to drop the plot only when she promises to find Hollis a good match herself.

Hollis is more concerned with surviving his first Christmas after losing his dad than with finding love. Dad’s champion horse is aging, and rumors started by an unhappy client threaten the horse training business Hollis inherited from his father. When the kind and talented Lucy offers friendship, he accepts simply to add cheer to the season.

It’s not long before his interest in Lucy deepens, but so do problems at his ranch. Saving his father’s legacy begins to look as impossible as earning Lucy’s trust. Especially when her ex continues to use her love of animals against her and she won’t stop pushing her single friends at Hollis long enough to notice she’s the one he’s falling for.

Despite their efforts to disrupt the Veil’s plans, they’re still marching toward their ultimate goal. Whatever that is. It obviously involves the mind control collars, but creating an army of menial servants seems less than ambitious. And if there’s one thing that Camus and the Veil have in plenty, it’s dark ambition.

Amber is using her infomancy to try to track down leads, Snow is working on figuring out the collars’ magic, and Maddox is forever upgrading and repairing Dusk Runner so Scarlett can take the motorcycle back into battle. Are they all just waiting for the other shoe to drop?

They have one lead, but the sand is ticking out on that particular hourglass. The tracer they’d placed on Kingston Trane will expire soon, and it only leads to the location of the next Veil atrocity.

However, Scarlett has always been good at getting into trouble. It’s her own dangerous kind of GPS. This time, the trouble will be the biggest yet, culminating in a final fight that she’d better be sure she’ll win.

What she doesn’t know is going to try to kill her. Camus has been preparing for years to deal with such a challenge. 

Can Scarlett and Runeclaw survive? Can they even prevail? As options dwindle, it seems less and less likely.

But when Lydia is presented with an opportunity that could rocket her to household-name status, she has to decide whether she’s willing to give up everything she’s gained in River Falls to chase her dreams—or if her heart has finally found its home.

Unfortunately the tight housing market has her sharing a duplex with quiet and mysterious Judd Landis. Terry is unsure about the situation, since they'll share a kitchen and bathroom, but Judd turns out to be the perfect roommate, except it's obvious he's hiding something. Maybe a lot of things.

Judd wants to do the good doctor a favor, and give her a place to stay, because he knows she giving up the opportunity for a more lucrative career to come back to her hometown, but he has carefully cultivated a cover to hide the Secret Saint things he's been doing in town and he doesn't need the noesy doctor blowing his cover, no matter how kind and compassionate - and attractive - she is.

When Terry is tasked with posting on the town's social media page about the actions and possible identity of the Secret Saint, Judd is in danger of being found out. But, as they work together through the Christmas parade and a hot chocolate contest as well as helping needy members of their community, the attraction between them is undeniable. Will they see that they can do more for the community - and each other - if they pair up permanently?

Instead, it came with more lies, more secrets—and a target on her back. Still untouched, still guarding what little peace she has left, Serenity is caught in the crosshairs of a legacy she never asked for. Cursed bloodlines. Hidden betrayals. A life that was sold off before she even knew how to fight for it.

Enter Zayden Banks. Quiet. Ruthless. Paid. A self-made millionaire with scars he doesn’t speak on and a code he never breaks. He doesn’t just protect Serenity—he claims her. Fully. Fiercely. But falling for Zayden means stepping into his world, where love is loyalty, and loyalty can cost blood.

He knows he messed up but plans on using every moment they have together to court Annamae the way he intended.

As Annamae nurses him back to health, can he convince her to take a second chance on his proposal?

Emotional turmoil. That’s the only way to describe my life right now. One minute, everything felt promising. The next, I was drowning in chaos.

Falling in love with Bank was a mistake—but it was one I’d never regret. His love was raw, addicting, and dangerous. I should’ve seen the heartbreak coming. I should’ve known better than to believe the promises. But I wanted to believe him when he said he’d change. I wanted to believe love was enough.

When Bank starts slipping back into old patterns, I give him a us… or the life he refuses to leave behind. And that’s when he did the unthinkable.

He changed.

But healing ain’t pretty. Not when two broken people are trying to hold each other together with shaking hands. We’re nursing fresh wounds, walking through pain, and learning that love doesn’t erase the past—it confronts it. And as we try to walk in our truth, that truth keeps getting messier.

In this explosive and emotional finale of a three-part series, hearts break, boundaries get tested, and love is forced to grow up or fall apart.

If you're a fan of African American romance, BBW romance, and second chance love stories rooted in real emotion, deep scars, and the kind of passion that doesn’t let go easy, then I'm Pregnant What You Telling Me For 3 will leave you breathless.

Luna Thorn’s past is a mystery… even to herself.

She arrived in Detroit amidst a swirl of lights and magic. She had no memory of where she came from. No idea why she was there.

Years later, she’s established herself as a force to be reckoned with on the Detroit magical scene. She ingratiated herself with the local reapers. She set up a community called the Cathedral to help those who had been displaced from their homes and families, declaring that nobody would fall through the cracks.
Still, doubt remains. Luna is determined to figure out why she’s in Detroit. She needs to know what she’s supposed to accomplish within the city’s crumbling boundaries. Her story is nowhere near finished.

When a body shows up on the grounds of the Cathedral, her quest kicks into overdrive. Ritual murders aren’t her forte, but this one is going to haunt Luna. Also haunting her is Jesse Wilder, a young detective who has been paired with an old friend. He has specific beliefs about what’s happening. Luna’s opinion doesn’t match up in the least.

He’s a “by the rules” guy. Luna likes to fly by the seat of her pants. She’s never met a problem she didn’t want to improvise.

It’s going to take both of them to solve this case. Even then, it will only be the beginning of their tale.

Settle in for excitement. Luna Thorn is about to change everything you know about the magical world.

Sire’s still running the streets with calm precision and raising his son like a king. But Kiersten... She’s messing with his focus. What started as something soft is cutting deeper than he expected—and that truth’s getting harder to dodge.

Meanwhile, Jream’s putting her broken pieces back together, but some cracks don’t heal easy. Saint dipped out without a word, and now that she’s standing strong again, she’s staring down a truth she never wanted to whatever they had might be over.

And Saint... He’s grinding in ATL, trying to stay ten toes down, but Jream’s silence is ringing in his chest like a shot. When she shows up in his city, he’s got no choice but to face everything he’s been running from.

Once Jude Kline was okay with being friend-zoned. He was too busy trying to keep up with his suave new-found cousins on their grandfather’s ranch to worry about romance, and it was easy to be friends with Kaci. She didn’t demand stories of his past. Come to think of it, she didn’t offer her own, either.

Kaci Moore doesn’t want to be found. She finagled her way into a position on her grandfather’s old friend’s ranch, and now she’s just keeping her head down and doing her job. Friendship with the rancher’s misfit youngest grandson is innocent enough, right? They can only be friends… but Kaci finds herself longing for more and it seems Jude might be doing the same.

Acknowledging her growing feelings will also mean acknowledging who she really is, and that’s not only revealing her real name. There’s more than one secret in her past, and Jude might land right in the middle of it all.

Neeley,4.55,33.0,280.0,English,0,2,32,53,189,Shapeshifters|Paranormal Romance|Paranormal,402142-legacy,2024.0,"“You ever think you got things organized, lined up like it’s supposed to be, everything’s good in your world, and then something completely unexpected falls into the middle of your plans like a bomb, making everything scatter into a million pieces and proving to you that you don’t have control of a single thing?”

“Um, no,” Ronan answered.

“Yeah, me neither,” Brandt said.

Brandt was raised in a shifter clan. It was apparent from a very young age, that Brandt — a Black Bear shifter — would be Alpha of the new generation. He has embodied that calling through character, strength, control, and honesty all of his life. As his cousins moved on and up in pursuit of their dreams, he’s held down the fort at home, making sure they all had a safe, secure place to come back to when the time was right. He’s more than happy with the life he chose. The only thing that is still a question to him is who his mate will be. He’s watched the generation before him made better, stronger even, when they met their mates, and he looks forward to the same. Which is why he’s thrown for a loop when the female that crashes into his life manages to do just the opposite.

Tempest has been lonely all her life. Sure, she had family who adored her, but she had no real friendships to speak of. It wasn’t that she did anything to make herself stand apart, she was just too powerful. The paranormals in her community could feel it rolling off her in waves — especially the children she so wanted to play with. They feared her. Now that she’s an adult she’s decided it’s time to move on. To find the place she can be herself, accepted and not feared. Unfortunately, the place she’s chosen to settle has one thing she didn’t count on. Her mate. And he’s doing everything he can to push her away despite sneaking around her place when he thinks she’s not aware he’s there. It’s fine. She’s used to being ostracized. It’s nothing new, and nothing she can’t handle. She doesn’t need him anymore than he needs her. The fact that his friends and family welcome her… well that’s just the icing on the cake. Makes it kinda fun to push his buttons.

Flowing silver hair, emerald green eyes, and more power than any one being has a right to hold within themselves is exactly what fate has planned for Brandt. And he’s not impressed. She doesn’t make him stronger. She doesn’t even soothe him. She drives him to the brink of losing his temper. She torques him intentionally at every turn, and takes pleasure in it! How can the fates have possibly thought sending him this female was the thing he needed most?!

He has a chip on his shoulder a mile wide, and everything to prove. With a dark reputation as a cowboy killer, he has wrecked every interview he’s done in his career. He’s the bull shifter everyone loves to hate, and he’s just fine with that, except there is one he cares about. One woman whose life he ruined. One woman he damaged. One woman who probably doesn’t even know he exists. When that one woman stands up for him and the other top three bull shifters of the circuit, and offers to manage them, he knows he’s in for a bad time. She drags ghosts with her, and they’re haunting him. All he needs to do is get from event to event, and buck those riders off before that eight second mark. But during the most important time of his career, Cheyenne is tearing down his walls. And for the life of him, he can’t figure out if that’s a good thing, or a very, very bad thing.

Cheyenne left the PBSR years ago when tragedy altered her life forever. She used to represent the riders, but now she’s turning traitor and switching sides. She’s taking heat from everyone to represent three titan bull shifters who don’t even understand what she’s trying to do for them, and want nothing to do with her. She’s in way over her head, but she did this on purpose, to get to know the man who demolished her life all those years ago. She needs to know if Two Shots Down is really the monster he pretends to be, or if he might be the only other person on earth who could understand what she’s healing from. These bull shifters are rough, and violent, and intimidating, but Two Shots Down is showing her a softer side to the bulls. He’s funny, and caring, and protective of her always, and sexy as hell. The more time she spends with her, the safer she feels with the monster.

Now it’s up to Two Shots Down. If he wants to be a part of Cheyenne’s team, he has to win events…and that means being the biggest, baddest bucker in the world.",244460883:4.62:681

For the first time in his life, he was distracted as hell, focused on the Kinsey princess. Ángel was determined to have her laughter, her loyalty, and the one thing he never expected to her love. Despite her family’s insistence on sheltering her from everything, Tamar Kinsey had made up her mind to master the underworld as well as her older brothers.

Sapolsky's acclaimed and successful Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress.

As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear—and the ones that plague us now—are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way—through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us sick.",216151199:4.29:9998|23719305:4.1:12940|64582:4.03:40816|28820444:3.96:8383|13543093:4.16:29506|198027942:4.23:1299|103867:3.95:9931|39380381:4.14:3403|8574712:4.15:10892|224004285:3.95:21|34466963:4.37:223720|24724604:4.22:519|120108:3.84:2966|216750975:4.11:192|228026850:3.89:664|239823475:3.41:209|1883269:3.9:190|61535:4.16:191792|58989432:3.63:16|24611964:3.94:2859

War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.

As Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.

Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.",4934:4.39:381885|7144:4.29:1065319|12505:4.21:214915|153747:3.56:612626|5695:4.3:62025|24280:4.21:839755|117833:4.28:415628|7126:4.32:1014747|19117:4.0:100479|1953:3.88:1007956|28381:3.98:95590|3836:3.91:303395|2623:3.8:869199|49455:4.17:223668|19089:4.04:178254|18114322:4.03:988150|57271721:4.16:168|77265004:3.93:505864|320:4.12:1095179|18254:3.88:425636|226378:4.11:63878|489732:4.13:1851967|10210:4.16:2304932|17690:3.94:390549|2165:3.81:1299525|4406:4.44:628627|49552:4.03:1376917|2175:3.71:372220|32929156:3.9:2019702|27822:4.1:70402

Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?

Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. 

Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. 

You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.

This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, that is the first of your premises to check.",168668:3.99:883348|58913358:4.53:19066|5129:3.99:2060158|7126:4.32:1014747|299215:4.15:25837|4934:4.39:381885|153747:3.56:612626|154244:4.32:1397|7144:4.29:1065319|81912:4.34:4255|18114322:4.03:988150|82256:4.18:4083|2165:3.81:1299525|656:4.17:363408|629:3.78:244360|61439040:4.2:5391669|4406:4.44:628627|15794037:4.38:708|51877:3.9:15087|3028:4.16:21458|1268994:4.29:2747|97820:4.22:9501|216228675:4.16:25|6613404:4.19:6200|34689759:4.31:1253533|3023:4.37:14191|4900:3.43:555298|3836:3.91:303395|15823480:4.1:924249|375802:4.31:1467553

First published in 1936, 'We the Living' portrays the impact of the Russian Revolution on three human beings who demand the right to live their own lives and pursue their own happiness. It tells of a young woman’s passionate love, held like a fortress against the corrupting evil of a totalitarian state.

'We the Living' is not a story of politics, but of the men and women who have to struggle for existence behind the Red banners and slogans. It is a picture of what those slogans do to human beings. What happens to the defiant ones? What happens to those who succumb? 

Against a vivid panorama of political revolution and personal revolt, Ayn Rand shows what the theory of socialism means in practice.

Ayn Rand  (1905–1982) was born in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg to a prosperous Jewish family as Alisa Rosenbaum. When the Bolsheviks requisitioned her family's business, they fled to the Crimea, and she later moved to America as soon as she was offered the chance. After beginning her writing career with screenplays, she published the novel 
'We the Living'
 in 1936. Her status was later established with 
'The Fountainhead' (1943)
 and her magnus opus, 'Atlas Shrugged' (1957). Also a prolific non-fiction writer, as well as the founder of the philosophical school of Objectivism, she has had an unequivocal impact on both literature and culture, regardless of one's perspective of her works.",97820:4.22:9501|299215:4.15:25837|60094616:4.56:25|386485:4.17:2004|789376:4.1:1816|154242:3.97:2312|99951:3.77:5172|209146289:4.25:52|81912:4.34:4255|68542:3.96:9846|1609224:4.34:14035|51877:3.9:15087|59307015:4.0:66|228216300:4.62:413|3561809:3.85:1615|47059:3.47:3380|39692:4.18:6961|12431981:4.23:393|96630:4.27:2817|77729:4.65:15239

Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""

All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.",22320:3.88:52499|6088007:3.89:361750|154091:4.02:48201|22200:4.02:59369|77711:4.13:66326|22326:3.88:26683|101265124:4.27:14650|6665847:4.16:48400|61789688:4.38:1318|274043:3.74:4355|18630:4.28:80079|40792913:4.04:114452|164154:3.99:118744|219849520:4.31:8566|77507:3.86:88320|89187:3.99:61379|22323:4.06:42491|48484:4.01:53349|21611:4.14:179605|77565:4.24:146635

Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett’s family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original.

Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.  Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman.

1202,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Steven D. Levitt|Stephen J. Dubner,4.01,20441,268,English,22403,40146,169516,335175,326808,Nonfiction|Economics|Business|Science|Psychology|Sociology|Finance,256612-freakonomics,2005,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.

These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.

Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.

What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.

Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.

In the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.
 
Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”).

In April, 1992, a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.

Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.",12262741:4.07:862532|20828370:3.86:13905|9791:4.07:443123|8664353:4.39:992928|1617:4.38:1354053|41733839:3.93:5855937|56916837:4.26:6820414|7445:4.33:1351499|5107:3.8:3865502|397483:4.0:753611|6493208:4.13:799828|35133922:4.47:1835462|19501:3.64:1836512|61439040:4.2:5391669|890:3.89:2809066|92057:4.37:289686|3228917:4.19:860214|127441416:4.2:4154511|7624:3.7:3174467|9418327:3.96:1051177|18144590:3.92:3528288|17165596:4.36:3465456|13079982:3.97:2801135|18600:4.23:64232|168642:4.09:724128|1202:4.01:894048|1852:3.91:469491|17851885:4.16:619528|23692271:4.34:1244485|170448:4.02:4491523

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.

Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.

Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.",925367:3.99:18247|18600:4.23:64232|139069:4.46:162657|18571:3.61:8130|9791:4.07:443123|8664353:4.39:992928|12262741:4.07:862532|6978889:3.98:7768|13149874:4.22:11358|6545608:4.12:118731|6309380:4.01:6909|397483:4.0:753611|154924:4.14:11378|6289283:4.3:232581|220341389:4.37:163032|2841802:3.94:6263|17780:4.17:118162|61714633:4.17:202142|33313:4.19:373123|401514:4.14:81693

Jane Austen called this brilliant work ""her own darling child"" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.

Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate.

Focusing on ""disruptive technology"" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss ""the next great wave."" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices.

But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.

Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.

Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",6613404:4.19:6200|299215:4.15:25837|1609224:4.34:14035|3023:4.37:14191|51877:3.9:15087|980031:4.14:2480|97820:4.22:9501|6388946:4.06:6474|386485:4.17:2004|44793924:4.34:949|1822167:4.35:1981|81912:4.34:4255|1609227:4.41:2057|154242:3.97:2312|1268994:4.29:2747|2153998:4.34:1654|2282233:4.06:138|125231490:4.42:449|36448501:4.17:14103|16599562:3.87:1475

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies."" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.",4898:4.01:87119|69242:3.98:98983|2615:4.04:60254|106835:4.24:150017|9512985:4.09:47404|7108725:4.1:265882|81948:4.07:96195|313605:3.94:86115|28815:4.21:175491|18077903:4.21:102097|30186948:4.17:378564|18176747:4.2:108508|21343:4.11:136232|36072:4.16:815646|12609433:4.13:558588|10127019:4.11:362664|6732019:3.98:175040|2612:4.01:851808|4865:4.22:1138024|18050143:4.15:394931

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.

Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.

First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.",166997:4.35:241218|256008:4.57:235599|4934:4.39:381885|139400713:4.16:149976|406235:4.34:245867|7126:4.32:1014747|7144:4.29:1065319|394535:4.15:216416|60811826:4.11:423224|6288:4.0:1027310|3876:3.79:490964|4981:4.1:1474495|457228:4.18:34969|27793819:4.34:97324|117833:4.28:415628|49552:4.03:1376917|35031085:3.9:1860340|15823480:4.1:924255|10799:3.82:351485|29044:4.15:1009032

Over 3.5 million copies sold. A bestseller across five continents. 

Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as widely practiced as this approach has been, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne’s research shows that is not the way to create profitable growth in the future.

In their book Blue Ocean Strategy—now expanded and with a new Preface by the authors—Kim and Mauborgne (INSEAD) argue that cutthroat competition increasingly results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating ""blue oceans""—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade. Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company, organization or government can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. 

A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”

 An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. 

 Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.",168668:3.99:883348|5129:3.99:2060158|13079982:3.97:2801135|5107:3.8:3865502|890:3.89:2809066|61439040:4.2:5391669|6288:4.0:1027310|49552:4.03:1376917|11:4.22:2003149|7624:3.7:3174467|170448:4.02:4491523|7745:4.06:376576|41817486:4.0:765369|2165:3.81:1299525|18114322:4.03:988150|4406:4.44:628627|12697427:4.2:776995|41733839:3.93:5855937|394535:4.15:216416|36402034:4.09:508650|35031085:3.9:1860340|3876:3.79:490964|70401:3.61:445877|485894:3.9:1401412|166997:4.35:241218|7144:4.29:1065319|51323334:4.38:19358|489732:4.13:1851967|23515727:4.17:243713|36236124:4.18:639361

Considered the greatest short story writer, Anton Chekhov changed the genre itself with his spare, impressionistic depictions of Russian life and the human condition. From characteristically brief, evocative early pieces such as “The Huntsman” and the tour de force “A Boring Story,” to his best-known stories such as “The Lady with the Little Dog” and his own personal favorite, “The Student,” Chekhov’s short fiction possesses the transcendent power of art to awe and change the reader.

To make the journey into the Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. From the very first page of Eckhart Tolle's extraordinary book, we move rapidly into a significantly higher altitude where we breathe a lighter air. We become connected to the indestructible essence of our Being, “The eternal, ever present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.” Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle uses simple language and an easy question-and-answer format to guide us.

Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. 

Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value.

The Glass Castle is a remarkable memoir of resilience and redemption, and a revelatory look into a family at once deeply dysfunctional and uniquely vibrant. When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family. 

The Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered.

The Glass Castle is truly astonishing--a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family.",35133922:4.47:1835462|1617:4.38:1354053|4667024:4.47:3000124|12262741:4.07:862532|60869516:4.02:1184676|17165596:4.36:3465456|36809135:4.37:3576682|19501:3.64:1836512|25899336:4.41:796338|43641:4.11:1694569|214151420:4.32:160965|9418327:3.96:1051177|6900:4.2:1186699|6493208:4.13:799834|12232938:3.86:2455557|59366244:4.44:1430177|18143977:4.31:1953034|38746485:4.44:1186328|242006:3.77:402889|50196744:4.68:254499|252577:4.15:656385|60811826:4.11:423224|214151202:4.31:385128|37435:4.1:1348522|220817728:4.34:535860|56916837:4.26:6820414|29780253:4.49:798296|8664353:4.39:992928|21853621:4.65:2045043|27161156:3.84:500446

And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued.

In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work.

The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.

Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible.

If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls “a lover of reality.”",55481231:4.17:10268|216151199:4.29:9998|59552636:4.44:10169|244383:4.2:38825|211025416:4.0:2409|1963638:4.21:141161|76334:4.16:218230|23164946:4.08:20167|213181082:4.15:35198|6265779:4.04:5234|845977:4.25:37591|6708:4.15:444299|28956892:3.99:27109|173673:4.19:33789|119760:4.03:48140|2602650:3.93:2168|50915816:3.82:3427|12291050:4.16:17098|195888789:3.93:2278|13167087:3.68:13205

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUSINESSWEEK

In this business classic—now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis—Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.

When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.

An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.

He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.

But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.

Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.

In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",2203:4.08:376600|8255917:4.17:82060|16130:4.22:198786|1067:4.1:247000|52309:3.85:91344|2199:4.28:199091|3147367:3.86:56689|106590:4.19:48543|35167685:4.26:216650|92057:4.37:289686|25541028:4.13:443034|16121:4.15:37131|2279:4.17:91210|41021344:4.05:42976|6462:3.96:43201|40929:4.22:60475|7968243:3.73:122822|22609391:4.17:98233|34237826:4.5:43503|9021:4.37:42555|112803:4.1:74693|55361205:4.32:272340|17851885:4.16:619528|10414941:3.94:108082|27220736:4.46:363577|2054761:4.16:54001|20821092:4.25:28151|767171:4.22:147370|9742:3.84:169416|7501962:4.22:82151

James Joyce's disillusion with the publication of Dubliners in 1914 was the result of ten years battling with publishers, resisting their demands to remove swear words, real place names and much else, including two entire stories. Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'.

Joyce's aim was to tell the truth — to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century and by rejecting euphemism, reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country.

Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners — a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled — and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation.",59716:3.81:213083|14942:3.78:353445|2794:3.69:96589|10975:3.86:195149|161427:2.98:52|4900:3.43:555298|17716:3.84:221043|77013:3.72:185937|34080:4.11:58885|17690:3.94:390549|230910361:3.65:3247|49455:4.17:223668|3876:3.79:490964|426504:4.4:78324|10799:3.82:351485|18839:3.87:113863|394535:4.15:216416|166997:4.35:241218|117833:4.28:415628|46114:4.14:53049

Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.

Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.

This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.

Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.

If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, also available in Penguin Classics.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.

Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear.

The Noonday Demon examines depression in personal, cultural, and scientific terms. Drawing on his own struggles with the illness and interviews with fellow sufferers, doctors and scientists, policymakers and politicians, drug designers and philosophers, Solomon reveals the subtle complexities and sheer agony of the disease. He confronts the challenge of defining the illness and describes the vast range of available medications, the efficacy of alternative treatments, and the impact the malady has had on various demographic populations around the world and throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by emerging biological explanations for mental illness.

His decision to use unrhymed blank verse allows him to come nearly as close to the meaning of the original as any prose reading could do, and allows him also to avoid the harrowing sacrifices that the demand for rhyme imposes on any translator. And his endnotes and other additions provoke answers to almost any question that could arise about the work."" —A. Kent Hieatt

A groundbreaking bilingual edition of Dante's masterpiece that includes a substantive Introduction, extensive notes, and appendixes that reproduce Dante's key sources and influences. Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem's line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with scholars, teachers, and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art.

And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever?

It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.

Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.",2696:3.53:237107|207546:4.26:1716|2262521:3.54:17161|6656:4.08:171021|52357:3.5:344412|18525:3.8:72111|765427:3.59:17277|15645:4.03:204769|220450463:3.87:142571|51190:3.01:16833|77265004:3.93:505864|1381:3.83:1181657|3049:3.76:77470|12938:3.91:236350|12985:3.78:226184|1715:4.1:77863|7733:3.59:297645|42038:4.25:112001|35031085:3.9:1860340|791479:3.31:5006

Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy’

In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in ‘activity of the soul in accordance with virtue’, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle’s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters.

J. A. K. Thomson’s translation has been revised by Hugh Tredennick, and is accompanied by a new introduction by Jonathan Barnes. This edition also includes an updated list for further reading and a new chronology of Aristotle’s life and works.

George Eliot’s most ambitious novel is a masterly evocation of diverse lives and changing fortunes in a provincial community. Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose pioneering medical methods, combined with an imprudent marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamond, threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past. As their stories interweave, George Eliot creates a richly nuanced and moving drama, hailed by Virginia Woolf as ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people"".",17883928:3.65:4192|31463:3.97:165532|32261:3.84:301466|5797:3.81:132878|156538:4.15:182388|31173:3.78:80127|31242:4.02:113712|53835:3.97:194459|337113:4.03:129807|59716:3.81:213083|656:4.17:363408|14942:3.78:353445|182381:3.83:47697|2156:4.15:770357|58696:4.04:257209|5890:4.01:165388|50798:3.83:75737|17728:3.98:105410|264:3.8:84942|38374795:3.96:94528

It traces the trajectory of Western civilization (as well as the Islamic and Mongolian conquests) from the height of the Roman Empire to the fall of Byzantium. 
 
The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, unusual at the time, its methodology became a model for later historians.

This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.

 Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.

 Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team.

Present here is a remarkable combination of the insight of the poet and the contemplation of the philosopher.

In The Sickness unto Death, Kierkegaard moves beyond anxiety on the mental-emotional level to the spiritual level, where — in contact with the eternal — anxiety becomes despair. Both anxiety and despair reflect the misrelation that arises in the self when the elements of the synthesis — the infinite and the finite — do not come into proper relation to each other. Despair is a deeper expression for anxiety and is a mark of the eternal, which is intended to penetrate temporal existence.",9454:3.96:20377|205218:4.1:21061|12321:4.03:112933|2823:3.98:21069|551866:4.07:11840|51985:3.98:45899|80449:4.12:35258|10033:3.99:34853|18288:3.96:42026|19068:4.0:59470|449407:3.94:14338|94578:4.26:20370|357636:3.79:44277|92307:4.05:27637|12075:4.1:22270|19506:4.22:11072|27037:3.99:73441|851994:3.95:14172|479356:3.81:19828|118317:4.18:8628

In the course of the essay, Tolstoy shows different attempts to find answers on the examples of science, philosophy, eastern wisdom, and the opinions of his fellow novelists. . . . finding no workable solution in any of these, Tolstoy recognizes the deep religious convictions of ordinary people as containing the key to true answers. The first attempt at its publication took place in 1882 (Russkaya Mysl, No 5), but Tolstoy's work was removed virtually from the whole edition of the journal by Orthodox Church censorship.

The Analects are a collection of Confucius’s sayings brought together by his pupils shortly after his death in 497 BC. Together they express a philosophy, or a moral code, by which Confucius, one of the most humane thinkers of all time, believed everyone should live. Upholding the ideals of wisdom, self-knowledge, courage and love of one’s fellow man, he argued that the pursuit of virtue should be every individual’s supreme goal. And, while following the Way, or the truth, might not result in immediate or material gain, Confucius showed that it could nevertheless bring its own powerful and lasting spiritual rewards.

This edition contains a detailed introduction exploring the concepts of the original work, a bibliography and glossary and appendices on Confucius himself, The Analects and the disciples who compiled them.

The trial and condemnation of Socrates on charges of heresy and corrupting young minds is a defining moment in the history of Classical Athens. In tracing these events through four dialogues, Plato also developed his own philosophy, based on Socrates' manifesto for a life guided by self-responsibility. Euthyphro finds Socrates outside the court-house, debating the nature of piety, while the Apology is his robust rebuttal of the charges of impiety and a defence of the philosopher's life. In the Crito, while awaiting execution in prison, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. Finally, in the Phaedo, he is shown calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul.

Hugh Tredennick's landmark 1954 translation has been revised by Harold Tarrant, reflecting changes in Platonic studies, with an introduction and expanded introductions to each of the four dialogues.

Plato (c.427-347 BC) stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He founded the Academy in Athens, the first permanent institution devoted to philosophical research and teaching, and the prototype of all Western universities.

Orwell did more than just investigate; he went down to the deepest part of the mine, lived in dilapidated and filthy workers' houses, and used the tip of his pen to vividly reveal every aspect of the coal miners' lives. Reading today, 80 years later, Still shockingly true. The despair and poverty conveyed by this picture have a terrifying power that transcends time and national boundaries. At the same time, the Road to Wigan Pier is also Orwell's road to socialism as he examines his own inner self. Born in the British middle class, he recalled how he gradually began to doubt and then hate the strict class barriers that divided British society at that time. Because in his mind, socialism ultimately means only one concept: ""justice and freedom.""",34640476:4.29:10966|10408011:4.08:10743|222377524:4.07:136|921359:4.04:10394|113250:4.08:5399|117002:3.97:2085|217388177:3.64:295|70561:4.33:34460|4900:3.43:555298|912517:3.83:759|2223313:3.44:1221|30551:3.95:4169|5129:3.99:2060158|250839:4.07:1838|58645209:3.78:259|647492:4.11:23182|30672:4.12:33569|61680070:4.35:370|699808:3.61:1217|30474:3.68:195705

Over two decades ago, the New Yorker published a now infamous article, “Don’t Eat Before Reading This,” by then little-known chef Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain spared no one’s appetite as he revealed what happens behind the kitchen door. The article was a sensation, and the book it spawned, the now iconic Kitchen Confidential, became an even bigger sensation and megabestseller. Frankly confessional, addictively acerbic, and utterly unsparing, Bourdain pulls no punches in this memoir of his years in the restaurant business.

Fans will love to return to this deliciously funny, delectably shocking banquet of wild-but-true tales of life in the culinary trade, laying out Bourdain’s more than a quarter-century of drugs, sex, and haute cuisine. Including a handwritten introduction and annotations done by Bourdain about a decade after the book was originally published, this edition also features previously unpublished photos to accompany the now-classic text.",69435:3.98:6853|7745:4.06:376576|220341389:4.37:163032|56221012:4.25:9459|139400713:4.16:149976|56645907:4.19:6645|1898:4.26:563493|123183412:4.36:90376|51700803:3.88:28095|40163119:4.47:162160|209192698:4.23:115002|60869516:4.02:1184676|207298822:3.83:22822|223436601:4.16:87838|55360284:4.19:95317|206318521:4.21:348008|60811826:4.11:423224|54814676:4.23:587608|208931300:3.82:323407|52838315:4.2:449844

So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.

Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.

As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.

Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas—this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart.

Beah tells how, at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he’d been picked up by the government army, and became a soldier.

My new friends have begun to suspect I haven’t told them the full story of my life.
“Why did you leave Sierra Leone?”
“Because there is a war.”
“You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?”
“Yes, all the time.”
“Cool.”
I smile a little.
“You should tell us about it sometime.”
“Yes, sometime.” 

This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. 

What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.

In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he’d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.

As one enters Juan Rulfo's legendary novel, one follows a dusty road to a town of death. Time shifts from one consciousness to another in a hypnotic flow of dreams, desires, and memories, a world of ghosts dominated by the figure of Pedro Páramo - lover, overlord, murderer.

Rulfo's extraordinary mix of sensory images, violent passions, and unfathomable mysteries has been a profound influence on a whole generation of Latin American writers, including Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel García Márquez. To read Pedro Páramo today is as overwhelming an experience as when it was first published in Mexico back in 1955.",56899:3.82:42540|1365225:4.13:30612|320:4.12:1095179|53447:4.02:92943|23875:3.8:66077|46041168:4.04:46967|23878:3.97:232744|56919:4.17:41870|961341:3.64:10801|53413:4.2:48652|2514766:4.33:7447|669450:3.78:8225|426504:4.4:78324|6952:3.95:392970|25489025:3.65:366848|12764:3.86:11733|63033:4.17:52095|60142:4.18:28153|5787:4.32:48497|94486:3.97:33605

Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, Virginia Woolf draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies. As their understanding of nature’s trials grows, the chorus of narrative voices blends together in miraculous harmony, remarking not only on the inevitable death of individuals but on the eternal connection of everyone. The novel that most epitomizes Virginia Woolf’s theories of fiction in the working form, The Waves is an amazing book very much ahead of its time.

In 1942, as the Nazis occupied Holland, thirteen-year-old Anne Frank and her Jewish family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until they were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived in the cramped “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they endured hunger, boredom, the strain of close quarters, and the constant fear of discovery and death.

Through it all, Anne documented her experiences in a diary filled with vivid observations. At times thoughtful, poignant, and even unexpectedly funny, her writing offers a remarkable window into the strength and vulnerability of the human spirit. It’s both a compelling self-portrait of a bright, spirited young woman and a heartbreaking glimpse of a life that should have been far longer.",11084145:4.16:1352439|56916837:4.26:6820414|42844155:4.47:11301333|25856606:4.12:5674450|41865:3.67:7252160|25541028:4.13:443034|61439040:4.2:5391669|2767052:4.35:9804601|41733839:3.93:5855937|24178:4.21:2030678|157993:4.33:2445264|38746485:4.44:1186328|59926998:3.74:2805877|129915654:4.29:4751466|132080146:4.24:3125032|170448:4.02:4491578|5107:3.8:3865502|18144590:3.92:3528288|98233:4.03:37852|4667024:4.47:3000124

A child's death and La Maga's disappearance put an end to his life of empty pleasures and intellectual acrobatics, and prompt Oliveira to return to Buenos Aires, where he works by turns as a salesman, a keeper of a circus cat which can truly count, and an attendant in an insane asylum. Hopscotch is the dazzling, freewheeling account of Oliveira's astonishing adventures.

The book is highly influenced by Henry Miller’s reckless and relentless search for truth in post-decadent Paris and Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki’s modal teachings on Zen Buddhism.

Cortázar's employment of interior monologue, punning, slang, and his use of different languages is reminiscent of Modernist writers like Joyce, although his main influences were Surrealism and the French New Novel, as well as the ""riffing"" aesthetic of jazz and New Wave Cinema.

In 1966, Gregory Rabassa won the first National Book Award to recognize the work of a translator, for his English-language edition of Hopscotch. Julio Cortázar was so pleased with Rabassa's translation of Hopscotch that he recommended the translator to Gabriel García Márquez when García Márquez was looking for someone to translate his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude into English.

The classic novel Zorba the Greek is the story of two men, their incredible friendship, and the importance of living life to the fullest. Zorba, a Greek working man, is a larger-than-life character, energetic and unpredictable. He accompanies the unnamed narrator to Crete to work in the narrator’s lignite mine, and the pair develops a singular relationship. The two men couldn’t be further apart: The narrator is cerebral, modest, and reserved; Zorba is unfettered, spirited, and beyond the reins of civility. Over the course of their journey, he becomes the narrator’s greatest friend and inspiration and helps him to appreciate the joy of living.

Zorba has been acclaimed as one of the most remarkable figures in literature; he is a character in the great tradition of Sinbad the Sailor, Falstaff, and Sancho Panza. He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he’s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love.

Ricardo ve cumplido, a una edad muy temprana, el sueño que en su Lima natal alimentó desde que tenía uso de razón: vivir en París. Pero el rencuentro con un amor de adolescencia lo cambiará todo. La joven, inconformista, aventurera, pragmática e inquieta, lo arrastrará fuera del pequeño mundo de sus ambiciones.

Testigos de épocas convulsas y florecientes en ciudades como Londres, París, Tokio o Madrid, que aquí son mucho más que escenarios, ambos personajes verán sus vidas entrelazarse sin llegar a coincidir del todo.

Creando una admirable tensión entre lo cómico y lo trágico, Mario Vargas Llosa juega en Travesuras de la niña mala (2006) con la realidad y la ficción para liberar una historia en la que el amor se nos muestra indefinible, dueño de mil caras, como la niña mala.

Michel Foucault has become famous for a series of books that have permanently altered our understanding of many institutions of Western society. He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable Madness and Civilization; hospitals in The Birth of the Clinic; prisons in Discipline and Punish; and schools and families in The History of Sexuality. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them.

Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent - and terrifying - portrait of society that he was patiently compiling.

For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power ""reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives.""

Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time - and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.",22613:4.0:16464|355190:4.13:29382|118317:4.18:8628|85767:4.05:19394|12075:4.1:22270|66933:4.34:31910|44901216:4.24:1985|61539:4.03:29743|51893:4.07:174684|92307:4.05:27637|396931:4.3:14571|18919:3.94:3493|134571:4.03:656|80449:4.12:35258|765338:4.1:1326|2823:3.98:21069|384786:4.21:3960|34746490:4.05:481|22397551:3.92:279|41717504:4.04:4956

J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, a brilliant physicist who led the effort to build the atomic bomb for his country in a time of war and who later found himself confronting the moral consequences of scientific progress.

When he proposed international controls over atomic materials, opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, and criticized plans for a nuclear war, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup during the anti-Communist hysteria of the early 1950s. They declared that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America’s nuclear secrets.

Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,
 Mises explains complex market phenomena as ""the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid undesired consequences."" It is individual choices in response to personal subjective value judgments that ultimately determine market phenomena—supply and demand, prices, the pattern of production, and even profits and losses. Although governments may presume to set ""prices,"" it is individuals who, by their actions and choices through competitive bidding for money, products, and services, actually determine ""prices"". Thus, Mises presents economics—not as a study of material goods, services, and products—but as a study of human actions. He sees the science of human action, praxeology, as a science of reason and logic, which recognizes a regularity in the sequence and interrelationships among market phenomena. Mises defends the methodology of praxeology against the criticisms of Marxists, socialists, positivists, and mathematical statisticians.

Mises attributes the tremendous technological progress and the consequent increase in wealth and general welfare in the last two centuries to the introduction of liberal government policies based on free-market economic teachings, creating an economic and political environment which permits individuals to pursue their respective goals in freedom and peace. Mises also explains the futility and counter-productiveness of government attempts to regulate, control, and equalize all people's circumstances: ""Men are born unequal and ... it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization.""

Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.

Bettina Bien Greaves is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as Human Events, Reason, and The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty. A student of Mises, Greaves has become an expert on his work in particular and that of the Austrian School of economics in general. She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.",299215:4.15:25837|6613404:4.19:6200|81978:4.48:1172|3028:4.16:21458|25698:3.89:34813|980031:4.14:2480|1609224:4.34:14035|746104:4.29:709|51877:3.9:15087|1044658:4.16:2882|81983:4.15:1576|97820:4.22:9501|3023:4.37:14191|662:3.69:405945|6617037:4.21:26605|75831:4.22:2517|385228:3.96:42819|36448501:4.17:14103|81980:4.19:1224|54388:4.36:328

The Worldly Philosophers not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas—namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.

In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics.

The Sovereign Individual details strategies necessary for adapting financially to the next phase of Western civilization.

Few observers of the late twentieth century have their fingers so presciently on the pulse of the global political and economic realignment ushering in the new millennium as do James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg. Their bold prediction of disaster on Wall Street in Blood in the Streets was borne out by Black Tuesday. In their ensuing bestseller, The Great Reckoning, published just weeks before the coup attempt against Gorbachev, they analyzed the pending collapse of the Soviet Union and foretold the civil war in Yugoslavia and other events that have proved to be among the most searing developments of the past few years.

In The Sovereign Individual, Davidson and Rees-Mogg explore the greatest economic and political transition in centuries—the shift from an industrial to an information-based society. This transition, which they have termed ""the fourth stage of human society,"" will liberate individuals as never before, irrevocably altering the power of government.

The Classic Text Annotated to Update Graham's Timeless Wisdom for Today's Market Conditions

The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of ""value investing"" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made The Intelligent Investor the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.

Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham's strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham's original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market, draws parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham's principles.

A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. 
When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.",13079982:3.97:2801135|41733839:3.93:5855985|56916837:4.26:6820414|7624:3.7:3174467|890:3.89:2809066|5107:3.8:3865502|485894:3.9:1401412|157993:4.33:2445264|489732:4.13:1851993|49552:4.03:1376917|5129:3.99:2060158|59926998:3.74:2805877|42844155:4.47:11301333|35031085:3.9:1860340|18144590:3.92:3528288|129915654:4.29:4751466|2165:3.81:1299525|127441416:4.2:4154511|7144:4.29:1065319|2767052:4.35:9804601

Finite games are the familiar contests of everyday life, the games we play in business and politics, in the bedroom and on the battlefied -- games with winners and losers, a beginning and an end. Infinite games are more mysterious -- and ultimately more rewarding. They are unscripted and unpredictable; they are the source of true freedom.
In this elegant and compelling work, James Carse explores what these games mean, and what they can mean to you. He offers stunning new insights into the nature of property and power, of culture and community, of sexuality and self-discovery, opening the door to a world of infinite delight and possibility.
""An extraordinary little book . . . a wise and intimate companion, an elegant reminder of the real.""

These stories that speak about objects and daily happenings, pass over to another dimension, one of nightmare or revelation.

These stories may upset readers due to a very rare characteristic in literature: They stare at us as if waiting for something in return. After reading these true classics, our opinion of the world cannot remain the same.

In consequence, he feels himself ""disqualified from being human"" (a literal translation of the Japanese title).

Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: ""His world … suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, … but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book."" His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.

Liebling never fails to find the human story behind the fight, and he evokes the atmosphere in the arena as distinctly as he does the goings-on in the ring--a combination that prompted Sports Illustrated to name The Sweet Science the best American sports book of all time.",773971:4.04:5483|188087:3.82:10505|154869:3.99:4878|52728158:4.37:144|18114335:3.46:9900|288987:3.9:5865|1006997:3.84:1592|42972023:4.2:18324|1824048:3.64:473|18595455:4.12:156|116826:4.26:4929|994937:3.72:2543|223889073:3.91:4130|220160582:4.22:1187|396931:4.3:14571|565816:3.89:7600|23398787:3.71:2247|23398667:3.64:1710|25167837:3.71:3106|23020954:3.64:3257

In the 1950s, who but the most rampant optimist would have dreamt that over the next fifty years the real return on equities would be 9% per year? Yet this is what happened in the U.S. stock market. The optimists triumphed. However, as Don Marquis observed, an optimist is someone who never had much experience. The authors of this book extend our experience across regions and across time. They present a comprehensive and consistent analysis of investment returns for equities, bonds, bills, currencies and inflation, spanning sixteen countries, from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. This is achieved in a clear and simple way, with over 130 color diagrams that make comparison easy.

Crucially, the authors analyze total returns, including reinvested income. They show that some historical indexes overstate long-term performance because they are contaminated by survivorship bias and that long-term stock returns are in most countries seriously overestimated, due to a focus on periods that with hindsight are known to have been successful.

The book also provides the first comprehensive evidence on the long-term equity risk premium--the reward for bearing the risk of common stocks. The authors reveal whether the United States and United Kingdom have had unusually high stock market returns compared to other countries. The book covers the U.S., the U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, and South Africa.

Triumph of the Optimists is required reading for investment professionals, financial economists, and investors. It will be the definitive reference in the field and consulted for years to come.",239217576:4.09:363|218319936:4.32:3565|27486:4.11:2763|25993570:4.39:1355|20696000:4.2:4923|10799:3.82:351485|2054761:4.16:54001|38315:4.08:70980|17371:4.17:1192|6012533:3.94:14030|207611500:3.92:3762|59056157:4.15:2722|49994260:4.07:21542|51801314:3.81:2419|2714607:3.9:30586|59046778:4.12:5481|48836:4.13:3942|1173576:3.91:34506|43889703:4.05:17133|40672036:4.05:94445

Gordon strips engineering of its confusing technical terms, communicating its founding principles in accessible, witty prose.

For anyone who has ever wondered why suspension bridges don't collapse under eight lanes of traffic, how dams hold back--or give way under--thousands of gallons of water, or what principles guide the design of a skyscraper, a bias-cut dress, or a kangaroo, this book will ease your anxiety and answer your questions.

 Or Why Things Don't Fall Down is an informal explanation of the basic forces that hold together the ordinary and essential things of this world--from buildings and bodies to flying aircraft and eggshells. In a style that combines wit, a masterful command of his subject, and an encyclopedic range of reference, Gordon includes such chapters as ""How to Design a Worm"" and ""The Advantage of Being a Beam,"" offering humorous insights in human and natural creation.

Architects and engineers will appreciate the clear and cogent explanations of the concepts of stress, shear, torsion, fracture, and compression. If you're building a house, a sailboat, or a catapult, here is a handy tool for understanding the mechanics of joinery, floors, ceilings, hulls, masts--or flying buttresses.

This terrifying and remarkable legacy is traced over eight centuries, from the Spanish Inquisition, to expulsions from England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Russia, and to the small Polish village of Zemyock, where the Levys settle for two centuries in relative peace. It is in the twentieth century that Ernie Levy emerges, The Last of the Just, in 1920s Germany, as Hitler’s sinister star is on the rise and the agonies of Auschwitz loom on the horizon.

We all know the In the game of life, why am I the only one who doesn't know how to play? But now, help is at hand, because this wonderful little book will teach you the rules so that you can conquer life's challenges and manage its unpredictable ups and downs.

For one of her workshops several years ago, Chérie Carter-Scott, a corporate trainer and consultant, composed a list of basic truths about life, which she named ""The Ten Rules for Being Human."" Right away, the Rules resonated with her clients, who photocopied and passed the list to friends and relatives. Within months, Chérie's Rules were in thousands of homes all over the country, and eventually, they were published in Chicken Soup for the Soul and have also appeared in Ann Landers' column. Although there's no formula to help you win the game of life, Chérie's Rules convey a universal wisdom that, once understood and embraced, can contribute to meaningful relationships with ourselves and others, at work and in the home.

In If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules , Chérie shares that there are no mistakes in life, only lessons that are repeated. In thoughtful, inspirational essays illustrated with encouraging personal anecdotes, she includes the lessons that can be learned from each of the Rules and offers insights on self-esteem, respect, acceptance, forgiveness, ethics, compassion, humility, gratitude, and courage. Best of all, Chérie shows that wisdom lies inside each one of us and that by putting the Ten Rules for Being Human into action we can create a more fulfilling life.",24019187:4.55:19672|4618898:3.87:19305|9420697:4.21:65640|28352410:4.02:21127|43453738:3.86:4811|773038:4.18:83063|137978862:3.8:15656|48613318:3.92:42516|52845775:4.19:43764|25733658:4.22:27222|60382742:3.84:16479|13521299:4.12:34370|20972:4.22:7673|170548:4.0:96571|58505300:4.21:15074|217159488:3.67:9821|195367863:4.34:1749|75601310:3.33:785|361396:3.89:9283|450534:4.19:33993

Borges sends us on a journey into a compelling, bizarre, and profoundly resonant realm; we enter the fearful sphere of Pascal's abyss, the surreal and literal labyrinth of books, and the iconography of eternal return. To enter the worlds in Ficciones is to enter the mind of Jorge Luis Borges, wherein lies Heaven, Hell, and everything else in between.

Rachel Carson's ability to combine scientific insight with poetic prose catapulted her book to the top of The New York Times best-seller list, where it remained for more than a year and a half. Ultimately it sold well over a million copies, was translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal.

The Sea Around Us remains as fresh today as when it first appeared over six decades ago. Carson's genius for evoking the power and primacy of the world's bodies of water, combining the cosmic and the intimate, remains almost unmatched: the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds of fathoms below the surface; the power of the tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in one bay alone; the seismic waves known as tsunamis that periodically remind us of the oceans' overwhelmingly destructive power. The seas sustain human life and imperil it. Today, with the oceans endangered by the dumping of medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, the gradual death of the Great Barrier Reef, and the melting of the polar ice caps, Carson's book provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the centrality of the ocean and the life that abounds within it. Anyone who loves the sea, or who is concerned about our natural environment, will want to read, or re-read, this classic work.",89232:3.95:2127|36606264:3.95:5062|123979539:4.22:2610|11797368:4.24:4302|43999702:3.86:795|40363053:4.42:1718|58884740:4.33:647|35721140:4.1:4237|55825856:4.04:2722|135490:4.29:3354|222376731:4.23:1261|60012295:3.89:406|1002561:4.16:148|22255090:4.26:275|3972625:3.79:126|171647:3.82:649|17288641:4.06:372|622839:4.24:774|29396396:3.95:2189|210436767:4.32:304|208840291:4.29:51037|286968:3.93:334|61952471:3.84:1890|1269548:4.12:516|40277347:4.35:4015|160653:4.39:4071|223736238:4.04:678|545826:4.22:386|34607045:3.6:178|55844144:4.46:193

He called it ""the fruit of nearly twenty years' work in the domain of practical psychology,"" and in his autobiography he wrote: ""This work sprang originally from my need to define the ways in which my outlook differed from Freud's and Adler's. In attempting to answer this question, I came across the problem of types; for it is one's psychological type which from the outset determines and limits a person's judgment. My book, therefore, was an effort to deal with the relationship of the individual to the world, to people and things. It discussed the various aspects of consciousness, the various attitudes the conscious mind might take toward the world, and thus constitutes a psychology of consciousness regarded from what might be called a clinical angle.""

In expounding his system of personality types Jung relied not so much on formal case data as on the countless impressions and experiences derived from the treatment of nervous illnesses, from intercourse with people of all social levels, ""friend and foe alike,"" and from an analysis of his own psychological nature. The book is rich in material drawn from literature, aesthetics, religion, and philosophy. The extended chapters that give general descriptions of the types and definitions of Jung's principal psychological concepts are key documents in analytical psychology.",91781:4.13:9876|706554:3.81:5584|93981:3.84:80691|180671:4.33:2323|49187:4.08:4391|94578:4.26:20370|132464:3.85:11258|26123:3.96:20725|12321:4.03:112933|80458:3.76:7247|312596:4.26:2238|66354:4.11:87987|85410:3.64:7941|132436:3.82:12334|49176:3.72:41098|233234:4.25:2947|357636:3.79:44277|25490:4.18:13563|46674:4.06:33985|851994:3.95:14173

What lies behind our small social panics and the maneuvers we use, to avoid losing face? Recognizing how much we care about how others see us, this wise and witty book tackles the complex subject of humiliation and the emotions that keep us going as self-respecting social actors.

William Ian Miller writes astutely about a host of homely and seemingly banal social occasions and shows us what is buried behind them. In his view, our lives are permeated with sometimes merely uncomfortable, sometimes hair-raising rituals of shame and humiliation. Take the unwanted dinner invitation, the exchange of valentines in grade school, or the ""diabolically ingenious invention of the bridal registry."" Readers will have no trouble recognizing the social situations he finds indicative of our often perilous dealings with each other.

Educated as a literary critic and philologist, by profession a historian of medieval Iceland, by employment a law professor, Miller ranges comfortably beyond his areas of formal expertise to talk about emotions across time and culture. His scenarios are based on incidents from his own college town and from the Iceland of the sagas. He also makes incursions into the emotional worlds represented in the Middle English poem, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and in some of the works of Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, and others. Indeed, one theme that gradually becomes specific is how meaning travels from one culture to another. Ancient codes of honor, he insists, still function in contemporary American life.

Some of Miller's narratives are unsettling, and he acknowledges that a certain ironical misanthropy may run through his discussions. But he succeeds in cutting through a mountain of pretensions to entertain and enlighten us.",61358638:4.27:60429|55723020:3.89:81414|61153739:4.33:93505

Today, unfortunately, the traditional place of mathematics in education is in grave danger. The teaching and learning of mathematics has degenerated into the realm of rote memorization, the outcome of which leads to satisfactory formal ability but does not lead to real understanding or to greater intellectual independence. This new edition of Richard Courant's and Herbert Robbins's classic work seeks to address this problem. Its goal is to put the meaning back into mathematics.

Written for beginners and scholars, for students and teachers, for philosophers and engineers, What is Mathematics? Second Edition is a sparkling collection of mathematical gems that offers an entertaining and accessible portrait of the mathematical world. Covering everything from natural numbers and the number system to geometrical constructions and projective geometry, from topology and calculus to matters of principle and the Continuum Hypothesis, this fascinating survey allows readers to delve into mathematics as an organic whole rather than an empty drill in problem solving. With chapters largely independent of one another and sections that lead upward from basic to more advanced discussions, readers can easily pick and choose areas of particular interest without impairing their understanding of subsequent parts.

Brought up to date with a new chapter by Ian Stewart, What is Mathematics? Second Edition offers new insights into recent mathematical developments and describes proofs of the Four-Color Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem, problems that were still open when Courant and Robbins wrote this masterpiece, but ones that have since been solved.

Formal mathematics is like spelling and grammar - a matter of the correct application of local rules. Meaningful mathematics is like journalism - it tells an interesting story. But unlike some journalism, the story has to be true. The best mathematics is like literature - it brings a story to life before your eyes and involves you in it, intellectually and emotionally. What is Mathematics is like a fine piece of literature - it opens a window onto the world of mathematics for anyone interested to view.",108986:4.35:9290|13237758:3.96:3354|3919273:4.0:35704|695429:4.19:5549|3869:4.21:476032|22463:4.01:121532|24113:4.29:52312|5546:4.61:8065|10884:4.17:201219|52377625:3.9:458|10883:4.05:149579|43713:4.47:4844|433567:3.81:77086|35167685:4.26:216650|192221:4.13:5131|433443:3.9:804|515601:4.44:11286|299215:4.15:25837|946185:4.34:216|6232657:4.21:3419

But most recent editors attribute it to an unknown author.

The Greek art of rhetoric was first naturalized at Rome in the time of the younger Scipio, and Latin treatises on the subject were in circulation from the time of the Gracchi. But the books by Cato, Antonius, and the other Roman writers have not come down to us, and it is from the second decade of the first century B.C. that we have, in the treatise addressed to Gaius Herennius, the oldest Latin Art preserved entire. Like Cicero's incomplete De Inventione, which belongs close to it in time, this work reflects Hellenistic rhetorical teaching. Our author, however, gives us a Greek art in Latin dress, combining a Roman spirit with Greek doctrine. It is a technical manual, systematic and formal in arrangement; its exposition is bald, but in greatest part clear and precise. Indeed the writer's specific aims are to achieve clarity and conciseness, and to complete the exposition of his subject with reasonable speed. He seeks clarity through the use of Roman terms, and of specially selected examples; he seeks conciseness by keeping practical needs always in view, by scrupulously avoiding irrelevant matter, and by presenting methods and principles, not a host of particular illustrations of a given point.",881319:3.88:6822|81779:4.09:88996|220450463:3.87:142571|682804:4.33:91515|449748:3.8:313|25673:3.95:13667|77265004:3.93:505864|1114881:4.25:188|385228:3.96:42820|12749:4.16:67879|103390:3.5:19107|27037:3.99:73441|24213:4.06:606202|545951:3.97:42948|1354:3.93:14587|30289:3.97:224559|6217:4.31:14349|12938:3.91:236350|15645:4.03:204769|1524:3.84:22500

You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. 

What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? 

Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. 

Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. 

In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place.

There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter ""Economic Reality"" has also been revised to reflect a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems.

""People sometimes ask me what they should read to find out about artificial intelligence. Herbert Simon's book The Sciences of the Artificial is always on the list I give them. Every page issues a challenge to conventional thinking, and the layman who digests it well will certainly understand what the field of artificial intelligence hopes to accomplish. I recommend it in the same spirit that I recommend Freud to people who ask about psychoanalysis, or Piaget to those who ask about child psychology: If you want to learn about a subject, start by reading its founding fathers."" -- George A.

Learn how related plants have similar features for identification. Discover how they often have similar properties and similar uses. Toms book takes you beyond the details towards a greater understanding of the patterns among plants. Most plant books cover only one or two hundred species. Botany in a Day includes more than 100 plant families and over 700 generaincluding edible and medicinal usesapplicable to many thousands of species. With this book you will be able to recognize patterns in plants everywhere you goin the wild, in your garden, among house plants, even at the florist. Understand the magic of patterns among plants, and the world will never look the same again! Many people recognize plants from the Mint family because they have square stalks, opposite leaves and most of them smell minty. I like to start my classes with a discussion of the the Mints because this pattern is so well known. What people dont realize is that similar patterns exist for other families of plants as well. Simply put, the study of botany is the study of patterns in plants! Learning patterns in plants is fun, and you only need to learn about 100 broad patterns to recognize something about virtually every plant from coast to coast across the northern latitdudes. In a two hour plant walk we typically start with the Mint Family, then progress through the Mustard, Pea, Parsley, Borage, Lily and Aster Families, so that every student can easily recognize these common families representing several thousand species. Ive had people tell me they learned more in that two hour walk than in an entire semester of botany in college. Thomas J. Elpel, Botany in a Day Thomas J.

It lasted only 12. But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading",1067:4.1:247001|40779082:4.18:84142|2767:4.09:264503|1842:4.04:454079|2203:4.08:376600|39020:4.05:94694|28789711:4.06:80360|10884:4.17:201219|8255917:4.17:82060|542389:4.33:40977|16130:4.22:198786|40718726:4.06:83149|2199:4.28:199091|76401:4.26:101668|42389:4.44:138161|20821092:4.25:28151|23692271:4.34:1244495|55403:4.3:68715|49250:4.31:31346|21:4.22:419810

In response, the technique of rhetoric rapidly developed, bringing virtuoso performances and a host of practical manuals for the layman. While many of these were little more than collections of debaters’ tricks, the Art of Rhetoric held a far deeper purpose. Here Aristotle establishes the methods of informal reasoning, provides the first aesthetic evaluation of prose style and offers detailed observations on character and the emotions. Hugely influential upon later Western culture, the Art of Rhetoric is a fascinating consideration of the force of persuasion and sophistry, and a compelling guide to the principles behind oratorical skill.",1354:3.93:14587|360882:3.96:11237|30289:3.97:224559|1607269:4.27:2924|159788:3.83:2131|780072:3.92:11379|28862:3.84:380213|381185:4.0:3060|848993:3.91:3779|846122:3.93:10271|982310:4.07:16330|811970:3.95:10241|73945:4.19:66144|385228:3.96:42820|31837:4.05:17760|26995:4.06:3253|29452503:3.66:900|30578:4.05:2965|60080:3.83:22576|261228:4.03:3357

Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. 

Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. 

Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. 

Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.

Told with Sagan’s remarkable ability to make scientific ideas both comprehensible and exciting, Cosmos is about science in its broadest human context, how science and civilization grew up together.

The book also explores spacecraft missions of discovery of the nearby planets, the research in the Library of ancient Alexandria, the human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the origin of life, the death of the Sun, the evolution of galaxies and the origins of matter, suns and worlds.

Sagan retraces the fifteen billion years of cos-mic evolution that have transformed matter into life and consciousness, enabling the Cosmos to wonder about itself. He considers the latest findings on life elsewhere and how we might communicate with the beings of other worlds.

Cosmos is the story of our long journey of discovery and the forces and individuals who helped to shape modern science, including Democritus, Hypatia, Kepler, Newton, Huy-gens, Champollion, Lowell and Humason. Sagan looks at our planet from an extra-terrestrial vantage point and sees a blue jewel-like world, inhabited by a lifeform that is just beginning to discover its own unity and to ven-ture into the vast ocean of space.",3869:4.21:476032|61535:4.16:191793|8049273:4.1:101998|32191710:4.08:205086|2094:4.26:42798|22463:4.01:121532|2095:4.19:45185|8520362:4.06:77196|14743:3.9:282199|21:4.22:419810|23692271:4.34:1244495|35167685:4.26:216650|53200:4.18:18400|11337189:3.94:30682|1168341:4.1:41381|33418:4.21:22629|20663770:4.1:32171|22435:4.13:40476|6117055:4.16:55976|31138556:4.19:285519|150131:4.1:13245|5553:4.21:30726|17362:4.23:13537|1842:4.04:454079|21413662:4.14:194589|33426:4.15:24166|8167094:4.11:20874|298252:4.23:4720|117047:4.09:41617|132695:4.19:7415

Beginning with the tragic early loss of his aristocratic father, then regaling us with tales of school, army and wartime hi-jinx, Niven shows how, even as an unknown young man, he knew how to live the good life.

But it is his astonishing stories of life in Hollywood and his accounts of working and partying with the legends of the silver screen - Lawrence Oliver, Vivien Leigh, Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Lauren Bacall, Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward and dozens of others, while making some of the most acclaimed films of the last century - which turn David Niven's memoir into an outright masterpiece.

Its vivid rendering of a gene's eye view of life, in lucid prose, gathered together the strands of thought about the nature of natural selection into a conceptual framework with far-reaching implications for our understanding of evolution. Time has confirmed its significance. Intellectually rigorous, yet written in non-technical language, ""The Selfish Gene"" is widely regarded as a masterpiece of science writing, and its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published.

Their quest: to track down the obscure, vanished poet Cesárea Tinajero. A violent showdown in the Sonora desert turns search to flight; twenty years later Belano and Lima are still on the run.

The explosive first long work by “the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time” (Ilan Stavans, Los Angeles Times), The Savage Detectives follows Belano and Lima through the eyes of the people whose paths they cross in Central America, Europe, Israel, and West Africa. This chorus includes the muses of visceral realism, the beautiful Font sisters; their father, an architect interned in a Mexico City asylum; a sensitive young follower of Octavio Paz; a foul-mouthed American graduate student; a French girl with a taste for the Marquis de Sade; the great-granddaughter of Leon Trotsky; a Chilean stowaway with a mystical gift for numbers; the anorexic heiress to a Mexican underwear empire; an Argentinian photojournalist in Angola; and assorted hangers-on, detractors, critics, lovers, employers, vagabonds, real-life literary figures, and random acquaintances.

A polymathic descendant of Borges and Pynchon, Roberto Bolaño traces the hidden connection between literature and violence in a world where national boundaries are fluid and death lurks in the shadow of the avant-garde. The Savage Detectives is a dazzling original, the first great Latin American novel of the twenty-first century.",426504:4.4:78324|53413:4.2:48652|230910361:3.65:3247|38787:4.05:98018|50272339:4.36:24811|59721:3.76:16621|2075382:4.2:25927|11455485:4.11:12126|60142:4.18:28153|2794:3.69:96589|119512:4.12:6392|5787:4.32:48497|27826456:4.25:6542|46041168:4.04:46967|382975:4.21:4497|415:4.01:47873|88442:3.98:26547|53970:4.38:11611|94486:3.97:33605|6759:4.25:100795

It is an archetypal American story of escape from domesticity tracing a young man's rite of passage through a series of terrible brushes with death during a fateful sea voyage. Included are eight related tales which further illuminate Pym by their treatment of persistent themes--fantastic voyages, gigantic whirlpools, and premature burials--as well as its relationship to Poe's art and life.

It is, rather, the total presence of fear, with the courage to face it. This book provides a bird's-eye view of the whole terrain--where fears originate, how to understand them, and how to find the courage to face them. In the process, Osho proposes that whenever we are faced with uncertainty and change in our lives, it is actually a cause for celebration. Instead of trying to hang on to the familiar and the known, we can learn to enjoy these situations as opportunities for adventure and for deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

The book begins with an in-depth exploration of the meaning of courage and how it is expressed in the everyday life of the individual. Unlike books that focus on heroic acts of courage in exceptional circumstances, the focus here is on developing the inner courage that enables us to lead authentic and fulfilling lives on a day-to-day basis. This is the courage to change when change is needed, the courage to stand up for our own truth, even against the opinions of others, and the courage to embrace the unknown in spite of our fears-in our relationships, in our careers, or in the ongoing journey of understanding who we are and why we are here.

Courage also features a number of meditation techniques specifically designed by Osho to help people deal with their fears.",143877:4.29:11991|870160:4.17:8532|13470:4.24:4558|29513878:4.19:20980|40651734:4.21:3545|57319844:4.12:1130|49125727:4.4:1692|17156136:3.76:1304|299869:4.42:6943|209933737:4.39:582|292:4.02:7831|18460102:4.66:639|1487022:4.29:2722|13451113:4.26:1192|198804978:4.07:111|240239295:4.93:182|784289:4.53:1539|13573312:4.33:3086|17371265:3.8:2585|16125800:4.19:1838

 No man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life, without the study of wisdom

Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC-AD 65) is one of the most famous Roman philosophers. Instrumental in guiding the Roman Empire under emperor Nero, Seneca influenced him from a young age with his Stoic principles. Later in life, he wrote Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, or Letters from a Stoic, detailing these principles in full.

Seneca’s letters read like a diary or a handbook of philosophical meditations. Often beginning with observations on daily life, the letters focus on many traditional themes of Stoic philosophy, such as the contempt of death, the value of friendship, and virtue as the supreme good.

Using Gummere’s translation from the early twentieth century, this selection of Seneca’s letters shows his belief in the austere, ethical ideals of Stoicism – teachings we can still learn from today.",30659:4.28:339221|4143812:4.4:11669|40534299:4.08:4750|19068:4.0:59470|18288:3.96:42026|12321:4.03:112933|10534:3.95:565439|30289:3.97:224559|28862:3.84:380213|51893:4.07:174684|24618:4.24:36169|43185339:4.24:2150|67896:4.29:181148|81779:4.09:88996|29093292:4.37:49794|4069:4.37:864389|91950:4.17:91383|1303:4.09:221387|73945:4.19:66144|224209170:4.27:5586

Zest. Gusto. Curiosity. These are the qualities every writer must have, as well as a spirit of adventure. In this exuberant book, the incomparable Ray Bradbury shares the wisdom, experience, and excitement of a lifetime of writing.

In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. When their ship was finally crushed between two ice floes, they attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization.

In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.

a spiritual masterpiece like no other. 
 
AUTHOR, TEACHER AND SPIRITUAL MASTER Jed McKenna tells it like it's never been told before. A true American original, Jed succeeds where countless others have failed by reducing this highest of attainments — Spiritual Enlightenment — to the simplest of terms. 
 
Effectively demystifying the mystical, Jed astonishes the reader not by adding to the world's collected spiritual wisdom, but by taking the spirituality out of spiritual enlightenment. Never before has this elusive topic been treated in so engaging and accessible a manner. 
 
A masterpiece of illuminative writing, Spiritual Enlightenment is mandatory reading for anyone following a spiritual path.

""The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."" With this characterization of the inevitable cycle of Chinese history, the monumental tale Three Kingdoms begins. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming Dynasty masterpiece continues to be read and loved throughout China as well as in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways that Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day.

Three Kingdoms portrays a fateful moment at the end of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) when the future of the Chinese empire lay in the balance. Writing more than a millennium later, Luo Guanzhong drew on often told tales of this turbulent period to fashion a sophisticated compelling narrative, whose characters display vivid individuality and epic grandeur.

The story begins when the emperor, fearing uprisings by peasant rebels known as the Yellow Scarves, sends an urgent appeal to the provinces for popular support. In response, three young men - the aristocratic Liu Xuande, the fugitive Lord Guan, and the pig-butcher Zhang Fei - meet to pledge eternal brotherhood and fealty to their beleaguered government. From these events comes a chain of cause and consequence that leads ultimately to the collapse of the Han.",158785:4.34:2691|158778:4.12:3085|18680016:4.53:2237|535739:4.0:2828|28510552:4.19:52|155054:4.05:2510|18048869:4.6:801|1362808:4.17:3630|25862450:4.72:292|59857105:4.32:1690|139874:4.2:2494|18049361:3.92:186|12265455:4.13:283|1210062:4.36:1247|100237:4.04:8052|18663411:4.39:733|18813423:4.36:990|16151179:4.09:4597|6317155:4.58:1582|18039262:4.39:189

Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.

John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.",4406:4.44:628639|6553843:4.08:11683|139400713:4.16:149976|406235:4.34:245867|256008:4.57:235610|27793819:4.34:97324|60811826:4.11:423224|6288:4.0:1027310|394535:4.15:216416|28921:4.14:356080|49552:4.03:1376930|1772910:4.08:325803|203200544:3.71:26225|60707:4.08:26882|208931300:3.82:323407|49455:4.17:223672|29044:4.15:1009032|58662236:4.1:410715|117833:4.28:415632|6334:3.85:843940

Broken into many short sections and peppered with Epstein’s own playful hand-drawn illustrations, the book does not simply give the right answer: It also goes into the answers that seem right but are wrong and shows why they are wrong — a rarity in science books.

Winner of the National Book Award

The publication of this extraordinary volume firmly established Flannery O'Connor's monumental contribution to American fiction. There are thirty-one stories here in all, including twelve that do not appear in the only two story collections O'Connor put together in her short lifetime - Everything That Rises Must Converge and A Good Man Is Hard to Find. 

O'Connor published her first story, ""The Geranium,"" in 1946, while she was working on her master's degree at the University of Iowa. Arranged chronologically, this collection shows that her last story, ""Judgement Day"" - sent to her publisher shortly before her death - is a brilliantly rewritten and transfigured version of ""The Geranium."" Taken together, these stories reveal a lively, penetrating talent that has given us some of the most powerful and disturbing fiction of the twentieth century. Also included is an introduction by O'Connor's longtime editor and friend, Robert Giroux.

From the composition of the brains and bodies of artificial life forms to the philosophical guidelines and computational frameworks that define them, Creation plumbs the practical, social, and ethical aspects and implications of the state of the art. But more than that, the book gives readers access to the insights Grand acquired in writing Creatures ―insights that yield a view of the world that is surprisingly antireductionist, antimaterialist, and (to a degree) antimechanistic, a view that sees matter, life, mind, and society as simply different levels of the same thing. Such a hierarchy, Grand suggests, can be mirrored by an equivalent one that exists inside a parallel universe called cyberspace.",54503521:4.05:6839|60321392:4.29:14909|64582:4.03:40816|57423646:4.58:12877|205363955:4.27:14806|22668729:4.12:49794|122765395:4.33:74463|39795104:4.01:509|90590134:3.81:14020|51641876:4.26:4414|112974860:4.04:37497|41160292:4.27:111543|62313346:4.21:4762|54505323:3.85:6762|42348818:4.1:37668|157981748:3.98:35776|50489373:4.18:3591|22816087:4.0:124475|198678736:3.95:13861|45024007:3.89:3875

The most important scientific book of the year."" ― Boston Globe In this book a master scientist tells the story of how life on earth evolved. Edward O. Wilson eloquently describes how the species of the world became diverse and why that diversity is threatened today as never before. A great spasm of extinction ― the disappearance of whole species ― is occurring now, caused this time entirely by humans. Unlike the deterioration of the physical environment, which can be halted, the loss of biodiversity is a far more complex problem ― and it is irreversible. Defining a new environmental ethic, Wilson explains why we must rescue whole ecosystems, not only individual species. He calls for an end to conservation versus development arguments, and he outlines the massive shift in priorities needed to address this challenge. No writer, no scientist, is more qualified than Edward O. Wilson to describe, as he does here, the grandeur of evolution and what is at stake. ""Engaging and nontechnical prose. . . .

""As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes."" 

With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, ""Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man.""",49552:4.03:1376930|1772910:4.08:325803|170448:4.02:4491578|489732:4.13:1851993|61439040:4.2:5391669|157993:4.33:2445264|7144:4.29:1065333|49455:4.17:223672|194746:3.94:246767|35031085:3.9:1860370|2165:3.81:1299525|13079982:3.97:2801135|18386:4.14:218274|5107:3.8:3865502|91950:4.17:91383|56616095:4.05:1203059|41733839:3.93:5855985|5129:3.99:2060158|52036:4.08:869210|59926998:3.74:2805877

My name is Kvothe.
I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.
You may have heard of me.

So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.

All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.

In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.",7235533:4.66:658072|68428:4.49:952556|17332218:4.76:478977|68429:4.38:642138|2767793:4.56:580112|29588376:4.3:337823|34002132:4.61:349426|944073:4.22:306990|49021976:4.58:233220|203578847:4.37:124765|58416952:4.6:179806|77197:4.19:394652|902715:4.36:213679|68427:4.17:343094|10803121:4.19:283755|944076:4.36:197204|228665:4.19:588391|15839976:4.27:740353|25300956:4.29:238984|18966819:4.49:454802

Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught?

Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup?

Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full?

And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar?

When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we?

In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.

Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same ""types"" of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us ""predictably"" irrational.

From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. ""Predictably Irrational"" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.",11468377:4.17:581837|3450744:3.84:94243|28815:4.21:175491|26530355:4.16:23496|66354:4.11:87987|6452796:3.95:125053|1202:4.01:894048|40102:3.96:620111|3228917:4.19:860220|38315:4.08:70980|242472:3.96:121193|69242:3.98:98983|2612:4.01:851808|6402364:4.0:134173|12609433:4.13:558592|40745:4.09:174156|41881472:4.29:310433|55339408:3.67:16085|123857637:4.34:208052|26329:4.05:134616

Or wondered why time flies when you are thoroughly engrossed in something? Or why minutes pass so slowly when you’re standing in line at the store or airport, or on hold waiting for a customer service rep to answer your call? Or how, simply, to find more time to relax and unwind?Now, with The Secret Pulse of Time, already a longstanding best seller in Germany, internationally best-selling and award-winning science writer Stefan Klein has crafted what amounts to “operating instructions” for time. “We are all taking part in a giant experiment in dealing with time,” Klein writes-and his aim with this book is to help us each to understand “the degree to which our experience of time hinges on our outlook on life.” With his journalist’s unerring eye for the telling detail, Stefan Klein effortlessly combines original investigation and reportage, personal revelation, and a wide-ranging, commanding presentation of scientific research among disciplines including brain physiology, social psychology, philosophy, and Einsteinian physics-with the goal of guiding us not only to better master time but also to understand why we so often fail to do so. Woven into his narrative are dozens of practical ways to make sense of and gain control over time, including: How not to lose your head when a deadline is quickly approaching How the present becomes a memory-and vice versa How to attune to your inner clock for more productive, satisfying days How to avoid becoming worn out by the fast tempo of modern life Popular science at its very best, The Secret Pulse of Time awakens us to and empowers us with the idea that time is far more at our disposal than we have ever before realized.",25490360:3.86:27381|35356384:4.16:31983|223188671:4.25:4146|208944736:3.79:124|302243:4.41:6003|211111711:4.0:139|60165429:3.91:636|46064083:4.32:2729|212026129:3.2:252|59799981:4.06:2705|55333158:3.99:5595|41443392:3.77:874|222340851:3.64:510|56591408:4.34:34315|45031830:4.06:1496|205169773:3.66:6595|6277018:4.15:14248|55723020:3.89:81414|69809:3.78:1544|48890486:4.14:113736

En su unidad formal descansa una gran diversidad de lenguajes, registros y tonos con los que Rulfo aborda la problemática de una violencia multiforme —desembozada unas veces, insidiosa otras—, hasta tal punto naturalizada que ha dejado de reconocerse como tal. Sin embargo, el autor no la ""refleja"" ni la ""denuncia"", ni tampoco la pone en escena: la persigue hasta sus repliegues más recónditos, compenetrándose con el sentir de quienes la ejercen o la padecen, sin alcanzar a reconocerla las más de las veces. O más precisamente: antes que la violencia misma, lo que los cuentos de ""El Llano en llamas"" ponen en escena suele ser ese oscuro y confuso bregar con su impronta en el sentir de quienes se vieron alguna vez envueltos en ella, sin advertir entonces su verdadero rostro",1365225:4.13:30612|56899:3.82:42540|1365229:4.03:5700|961341:3.64:10801|1053305:3.67:4882|23875:3.8:66077|1033955:4.22:3596|2514766:4.33:7448|1981412:4.23:3937|1176395:4.05:1533|56919:4.17:41870|63033:4.17:52097|1660961:3.93:4144|53447:4.02:92944|191373:4.19:24088|5787:4.32:48497|1636490:3.76:853|53413:4.2:48652|426504:4.4:78324|1660957:4.12:6338

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts , Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.

Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, which range from the ""purely aesthetic"" to ""sacramental vision"".

Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.

Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.

While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner.

In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.",26089423:3.78:826|255127:3.93:35949|11721966:4.13:17443|44245196:4.07:10198|45303387:4.07:3794|5597902:4.11:3499|199699997:4.27:357|218319936:4.32:3565|176444106:3.96:35163|944652:4.4:17197|61327449:4.28:9012|61058107:4.38:2010|35957157:3.82:22827|23463279:4.7:10420|198678736:3.95:13862|204927599:4.16:43136|39996759:4.22:4382|214268997:4.03:3018|25666050:4.12:34738|52200318:4.16:2070

His animated discussions were celebrated for their rhetorical wizardry and were written down by Arrian, his most famous pupil. Together with the Enchiridion, a manual of his main ideas, and the fragments collected here, The Discourses argue that happiness lies in learning to perceive exactly what is in our power to change and what is not, and in embracing our fate to live in harmony with god and nature. In this personal, practical guide to the ethics of Stoicism and moral self-improvement, Epictetus tackles questions of freedom and imprisonment, illness and fear, family, friendship and love, and leaves an intriguing document of daily life in the classical world.

How did life invent itself? Where did DNA come from? How did consciousness develop? Powerful new research methods are providing vivid insights into the makeup of life. Comparing gene sequences, examining atomic structures of proteins, and looking into the geochemistry of rocks have helped explain evolution in more detail than ever before. Nick Lane expertly reconstructs the history of life by describing the ten greatest inventions of evolution (including DNA, photosynthesis, sex, and sight), based on their historical impact, role in organisms today, and relevance to current controversies. Who would have guessed that eyes started off as light-sensitive spots used to calibrate photosynthesis in algae? Or that DNA’s building blocks form spontaneously in hydrothermal vents? Lane gives a gripping, lucid account of nature’s ingenuity, and the result is a work of essential reading for anyone who has ever pondered or questioned the science underlying evolution’s greatest gifts to man.",48894047:3.87:4416|4591:4.06:27949|83817782:4.23:7598|12013:4.2:33941|211003737:3.7:312|27276428:4.35:55324|224003186:3.65:813|55972588:4.39:150|11337189:3.94:30682|1662160:4.04:28675|51199750:4.15:2688|177068:4.14:5901|61535:4.16:191793|201751520:3.92:912|123202357:4.08:910|34324534:4.13:4795|7170627:4.34:113529|36442813:4.13:37997|240617:3.83:16880|57331880:4.2:3628

In his acclaimed book―based on his legendary Harvard course―Sandel offers a rare education in thinking through the complicated issues and controversies we face in public life today. It has emerged as a most lucid and engaging guide for those who yearn for a more robust and thoughtful public discourse. ""In terms we can all understand,"" wrote Jonathan Rauch in The New York Times, Justice ""confronts us with the concepts that lurk . . . beneath our conflicts.""

Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, national service, the moral limits of markets―Sandel relates the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day, and shows how a surer grasp of philosophy can help us make sense of politics, morality, and our own convictions as well.

Justice is lively, thought-provoking, and wise―an essential new addition to the small shelf of books that speak convincingly to the hard questions of our civic life.",217812221:3.87:1037|2139878:4.11:1027|34640476:4.29:10971|100020:3.6:707|129237:3.96:13537|332138:4.18:6355|124939807:4.19:65360|83817782:4.23:7598|203633779:4.35:43|35356384:4.16:31983|385228:3.96:42820|7734691:4.09:3289|204927599:4.16:43136|2070418:3.34:56|467770:4.28:1184|60080:3.83:22576|176444106:3.96:35163|584637:3.68:24983|91953:3.7:52568|29378:4.07:3526

In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.

Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the ""dog whisperer"" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand.
